    "transcript":"Conan O’Brien: The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor (2025) [uplifting rock music playing] [rock music continues] [camera shutter clicking] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a new era of The Kennedy Center, a Kennedy Center that celebrates true American values. This vaunted stage will now showcase distinguished, elegant, and revered entertainment that we as a nation can be proud of. [spotlight clicks on] [circus music playing] [male voice] Good evening, and welcome to The Kennedy Center. Thank you all for coming, and shame on you for being here! [laughter] That should cover it, yes? And now, ladies and gentlemen… [drumroll] …please welcome your 26th winner of the Mark Twain Prize winner, Conan O’Donnell! [upbeat orchestral music plays] Thank you. Thank you very much! This is so crazy. [upbeat orchestral music continues] Oh yes! Oh yes! Thank you very much. How would your co-workers describe you? I could say I’m fair, honest, and endlessly creative. You’re supposed to use one word or less. You look like a ginger crash test dummy. I wish I had your confidence. No, I’m just deluded. I’m fine. I guess I’m sort of the warm-up guy now. All right, freeze. You’re under arrest for public display of a bonah. You know, I fancy myself a bit of a filmmaker. Hello, job? Television job? You better be as good as Letterman. [announcer] Here’s your host, Conan O’Brien! Basic cable. Basic cable. [both exclaim] Do you see the bits? This never stops. [in high-pitched voice] ♪ In the year 2000 ♪ My next guest is– The Interrupter! [upbeat jazz music plays] Heehaw! You’re a bastard. Yes, I know. He goes into character when he doesn’t want to address reality sometimes. [in a funny voice] This is not true. [growling] You can’t be on pills and drive. Thank you. Please remain seated. We did it! Yeah! Welcome to Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend. [orchestral music rises then stops] Yeah! Grab me a 40. And when you’re getting him a “fotee,” could you get me a 40? [upbeat jazz music plays] [upbeat orchestra music plays] A stand-up comedian, an actor, and now a late-night host, he is a true single threat. Please welcomeJohn Mulaney! Good evening. My name is John Mulaney. It’s an honor to be here at The Kennedy Center, or as it will be known next week, “The Roy Cohn Pavilion for Big, Strong Men Who Love Cats.” Congratulations to my friend Conan O’Brien on receiving the 26th and final Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. [crowd laughing, cheering] When I heard Conan O’Brien was receiving the 2025 Mark Twain Prize, I was reminded of something that David Berkowitz, aka the Son of Sam, said when he was apprehended on a hot Yonkers night in 1977. “Hey, what took you guys so long?” Most speeches like this do a bunch of jokes, and they save the nice part for the end. I’m going to get it over with and do the nice part first. Conan O’Brien, you’re my hero. Because of you, I set about to be a comedy writer, who also somehow, despite all the data, gets to be on TV. And because of you, I am. You showed me how a bizarre Catholic man, who presents well but is deeply troubled on the inside… [audience laughs] …could navigate the entertainment industry. I have copied and stolen from you in every way possible. Conan, I sincerely thank you. I… I was watching the nightLate Night with Conan O’Brienpremiered, September 13, 1993, and I liked you so much, so immediately, that little did I know that being your biggest fan for 32 years would be one of the most emotionally taxing experiences of my life. Being a Conan fan since the early days has been so stressful. There’s always a goddamn petition to sign… [laughter] …or some kind of protest to save him. It’s like being the fan of a rec center in a gentrified neighborhood that developers want to tear down. There’s no argument for it, but we’re like, “Don’t take it away from us!” Conan’s early days were rocky, and at one point, he was on a series of 13-week contracts, a fact I have known since I was 12 years old. No 12-year-old should walk around being like, “Oh my God, Conan’s up for renewal.” It’s not stress a child should feel. Now, you think, maybe, did you have any primer for this? I was a Cubs fan, so I knew how to root for people that lose constantly, but… [audience laughs] …with Conan, it was like being a Cubs fan, but you think the way they lost was so brilliant that they won, and you’re trying to convince the scoreboard. It was like being a Cubs fan if after each game, there was a serious discussion as to whether or not the Cubs should be allowed to be a team anymore. But I was so happy to be on your team. I spent the next decade trying to follow in your footsteps. In July 2008, I was at dinner with my mom, and I got a call that I’d been hired to be a writer at Saturday Night Live. And I went back inside, and I told my mom, and the waiter overheard me, and he said, “Do you know that’s how Conan O’Brien started?” And I said, “I’ve known that half my life, you fucking moron.” I was headed to Conan’s old job, as his star continued to rise and rise. Then, 2010, Jesus Christ, once again, I gotta chain myself to the tree of Conan as the bulldozers closed in. But hey… enough about that time. Conan has been very clear that he has moved on with wisdom and grace. Meanwhile, all his radicalized acolytes were just left wandering around the country, jaded and paranoid that the people paying us are actually our enemies. It’s a mess. Conan was like, “Don’t be cynical,” and then collected a cool $50 million. You are the richest underdog in this town. Yeah, I know. Conan, you accomplished something extraordinary. You’ve stayed on our screens, brilliant, always from the drop, but adapting and innovating and bobbing and weaving and figuring it out again and again. You did it. You won. I am reminded… [audience cheering, applauding] …of a quote that is often attributed to Mark Twain, though many claim it was first said by the Son of Sam. Historians still debate its origins, but either way, it’s apt for tonight. So again, unclear who said this, Mark Twain or the Son of Sam. “Dear Jimmy Breslin…” “This is the Son of Sam.” [audience laughing] “Don’t think that because you haven’t heard from me for a while that I went to sleep. No.” “Rather, I am still here, like a spirit roaming the night, thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping to rest, anxious to please Father Sam.” “I love my work, and now the void has been filled.” “Yours in murder, Mr. Monster… [audience laughing] …aka the Son of Sam.” [audience laughs] Thank you for letting me be here, and congratulations, Conan. [cheering, applauding] [upbeat music playing] [announcer] This next guest can make anything funny, except his last seven movies. Please welcomeWill Ferrell! So, okay, uh… Look, I don’t even know how to get into this, um… Is Conan– Is he even here tonight? Do we know? [laughter] Is– No? Is he here? Any idea? Where? Where? Oh, okay. All right. All right. Look, my therapist told me to not make tonight about myself, which I would generally agree with. Uh, this is such a special night, but… But I’m sorry, I just have to address the elephant in the room, uh… So, for those of you who might not know this about me, I received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2011. No, no, no. Thank you. Thank you. It was a much more competitive field back then. And– But that’s neither here nor there. And I was lucky enough to have Conan O’Brien, the man sitting right over there, speak on my behalf, as I am doing now, and Conan gave some lovely remarks. After the show, Conan came up to me, and he said, “Congratulations,” I was so deserving, and that, you know, I was one of the funniest people he’d ever been around. But then Conan said something to me, and I remember it like it was yesterday. And he said, “Hey, just so you know, if they ever offer me the Mark Twain Prize, I will say no.” [audience laughs] “I will not accept it out of respect for you.” [audience laughs] I didn’t, no. [shouting] Yes, yes, you did! Yes, you did. Oh my gosh! You totally said that! [Conan laughs] Oh my God! Oh my God, you said that! Oh my God! I did not. Oh, this is so rich! [laughter] Oh my God! This is a total Conan move! Are you saying that I made this up? Is that what you’re saying? Look, I know this is your night, but you look like an idiot right now! You look out of your mind! I just knew this would happen. And I don’t have time for this! You know what I’m supposed to be doing right now? Do you have any idea? I’m supposed to be shutting down the Department of Education, okay? But now I’m dealing with this horseshit! Now, Jackie, my therapist, warned me that this might happen. [audience laughs] That you wouldn’t acknowledge the situation, and that… I needed to wrap my head around the fact that maybe, just maybe, you, Conan O’Brien, did indeed deserve this award. That you are in fact, my friend, one of the quickest, smartest, funniest minds I’ve ever come across. The truth is, you will never know how much confidence your generosity gave me as a performer. As I dragged many of your studio audiences through long, elaborate bits, with very little payoff, very much like this speech that I’ve subjected all of you to… No matter how crazy the idea was, you never said no. When you left The Tonight Show because The Jay Leno Show at 10 p.m. was just too damn popular… [audience laughing] It was a cultural moment, Jay Leno at 10 p.m. It was in the zeitgeist. Your last show, I watched you address the audience, asking us to never get cynical, to still fight for what we all believed in, whether it was in comedy or in life. And despite what you told me that night at the post-show party in 2011, I think you actually deserve this award. Congratulations. [audience cheering, applauding] Super smart people are great comedians, and he’s not threatened by someone being just as funny or, heaven forbid, funnier. That doesn’t always happen. It doesn’t happen a lot. But that’s why we’re all here. [announcer] Please welcome the femaleRicky Gervais, but with funnier jokes and smaller tits,Nikki Glaser! [Nikki] Oh, good evening. It was the fall of 1998, my freshman year of high school, my dad had just gotten home from work, and he’s like, “You have to watch this show I recorded last night for you.” “I know you’re gonna love it.” So I, like, begrudgingly sit down. He pops in this VHS tape, and what I saw completely changed my life. It was a sex tape he and my mom had shot over the weekend, but once… [laughter] Once he located the right tape, and I stopped vomiting, he played me… He played me the fifth anniversary special of Late Night with Conan O’Brien, and my mind was blown more than my dad was on the first tape. I couldn’t believe it. I was like, “How has this been on for five years, and I’m just now finding out about it?” And my dad was like, “Because it was bad for the first three.” I was like, is this even a late show? I mean, I guess, because he’s a man in a suit, interviewing a prestigious actor. But then one commercial break later, and he was in a screaming match with a character called Coked-Up Werewolf. It was this juxtaposition of decorum and chaos that made Conan so special to me, and it just gave me hope that maybe someday I could be an adult and sound like an adult and be respected by adults and still act like a fucking idiot. But Conan isn’t just a mastermind of unbridled silliness. He also gave us permission to laugh at some of the most depraved, immoral comedy you have ever witnessed on TV. There’s this one bit he would do on Late Night where he would play random scenes from the TV series Walker, Texas Ranger. Yes. I’m about to play my favorite one ever, and, Conan, I think you know the one. And that one’s about to be played here at the prestigious Kennedy Center. Let her rip. And how you doing, little partner? Fine. And it’s Little Visitor now. “Adawa Yoli” is how you say it in Cherokee. Uh… Pardon my French, but I’ll be damned. [laughter] Walker told me I have AIDS. [audience laughing, applauding] [Nikki] That is trademark Conan. A good Catholic boy despondently staring into the fake night sky, disavowing any responsibility for a bit he not only approved of, but rehearsed. [audience laughs] A bit like that only works if the audience knows you’re a good person, and someone they can trust. And, Conan, you’re that guy. I remember when I first did your show, and I was a nobody comedian doing my first late night set, and after my set, you took the time to come backstage and hang out with me and my parents for like a half hour, giving us truly one of the greatest moments we’ve ever shared as a family. And we’ve been to Branson. [audience laughs] Conan, you prove that not only can you meet your heroes, but when you do, they’ll flirt with your mom. I tell you this every time I see you, but you’re the funniest person who’s ever lived. I’m sure of it. And whether it’s you playing old-timey baseball, or you relentlessly mocking the way Jordan Schlansky pronounces “Tango,” or the way you created a space for bizarre characters like Preparation H. Raymond, Minty the Candy Cane who fell on the ground, or– Or me! The Interrupter! [Nikki] Oh God. Oh no. How the hell did you– Slip past security? Oh, what did you do? Tell them you’re– Bill Burr’s aromatherapist? Oh, come on. This is The Kennedy Center. This place– Used to mean something. All right. All right. That’s enough. Tonight we’re celebrating– The work of that ginger freak. Hey! That ginger freak just hosted– The Oscars. All you’ve ever done is host– Intestinal parasites. Show Conan some respect. He’s a comedy legend. And you represent– The lowest point of his 40-year career. Well, I don’t think that’s true because– He does a podcast now. But… [audience laughs] I mean, that’s not really a low point because, I mean– Everyone has a podcast now. Wait, don’t tell me you have a podcast. Where I review men’s restrooms with Corey Feldman. [Nikki] Oh, good God. I mean, that sounds like it has– Zero listeners? I mean, especially considering that– It’s a different Corey Feldman. What? So, wait, it’s not even– Corey Feldman the actor? It’s Corey Feldman– The disgraced toll booth worker. I mean, that’s just the– Most pathetic thing you’ve ever heard? I mean, yeah, unless you tell us you’re– Wearing the cape Shirley Temple was buried in? [audience laughs] Will you please just– Give you this cape? No, I don’t want that cape. I want you to– Get the hell out of here? Yeah. Don’t you have a– Cabinet meeting to get to? [Nikki] Wait. No. Wait, so you’re the new– Secretary of Housing and Urban Development? Even though you– Never even lived in a house. [laughter] And you’re also a– Registered sex offender. Oh, which this administration actually considers– A massive plus. [Nikki] Okay. Okay. This has obviously– Gone on way too long? Yeah. But really, I mean, what better way to honor Conan than with– A character nobody asked for. [Nikki] Yeah. And a bit that wastes everyone’s time. Bingo! Thank you, The Interrupter! Thank you, Conan. It is an honor to honor you. I love you. I hope you let this in. Good night. [upbeat orchestral music plays] [announcer]The New York Timescalls him one of the greatest living stand-up comics. The Proud Boys call him wasted potential. Here isBill Burr! All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Nice to be here. Conan. Great to see you and everything. Nice to be here at The Kennedy Center. Uh, nothing says comedy like the free-flowing creative vibes of the District of Columbia. [Bill] You know? I don’t know what it is. There’s something about, you know, starting and prolonging wars while crushing the working man for your own self-interest that really inspires all who gather on this fertile ground. [audience cheers] Yeah. I wouldn’t have missed this for the world. When they asked me to come out here, I knew I had to show up because I always felt a kinship for Conan, even before I met him, just as a fellow redhead. We are an unseen minority. Hiding in plain sight under the shade of a tree. [audience laughs] Watching all you pigmented people basking in the sun. But I had it easier than him because, you know, I was regular size. You know? But Conan… [chuckles] Conan couldn’t hide. Just a 6’6″ abrasion. Just walking onto the playground, looking for friends. You just look at him, you know the poor bastard never had a chance. And thus, another great comedy career was made. That’s why he’s here. Yes. So, when I was growing up, I was a huge fan of stand-up comedy, and I’d watch all my favorite comedians go on the late night shows and do sets. If you were lucky enough, if you didn’t bomb, you got to possibly get called over to the couch and actually talk to the host. And I became fascinated. My little pasty brain would be watching a square TV, looking at these comedians, and there was something about being called to the couch, that it showed, you know, you belonged with all of these movie stars telling their long, meandering stories that went nowhere… [audience laughs] …torturing the host. It was the back and forth. You had to listen to the other person, you had to give space, and if the other person was going down, you jumped in to save them. And in my experience, in this business, no one was better than Conan O’Brien. Yeah. So… here come the compliments, buddy. You’re not gonna like this, but you have to sit there and take it. All right? I don’t know. Every time I went on his show, I just felt so comfortable. He always seemed to know where I was going, and he perfected this art of acting like he didn’t know where I was going, and all he was doing was teeing me up for the next big laugh. I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed doing your shows over the years. I just love how his brain works. He’s so funny, he’s so fast, and whenever I’m with him, I always know it’s going to be all right, ’cause he’s going to set me up, jump in to save me and always make me look good, because he’s fucking awesome. So… Believe it or not, I consider you my eight-foot older brother in this business. The one who got to keep his hair. I’m so happy for you, and I can’t think of anyone more deserving of this award. I really can’t. All right? So, now I’ve said all the nice things. I’m now going to go back to being the walled-off German-Irish lunatic that I am. And, Conan, I think we both know neither one of us will speak of the nice things that I said about you this evening. I imagine at the after-party, it’s going to be an awkward handshake, followed by a poorly-executed side hug. And once we’ve taken care of that business, we’ll probably make fun of fat people eating too much cake, or a sunken cruise ship, whatever we need to do. Laugh at the misfortune of others, while we reset our friendship to the emotionally distant place that it exists all these years. Congratulations, you truly deserve this. Thank you so much. Good night. When you’re first starting comedy, it’s really about the community. You’re hanging out with comedians all the time, and as you go off, you don’t really get to hang out with people as much anymore. And so I think the thrill in that room is you’re with people who can, like, riff with you. It feels really special because it’s Conan, because I can’t think of someone who’s more beloved than Conan O’Brien. I’ve been a fan of Conan’s since I first moved to America. I moved here for college on my own, no family, just this kid from Pakistan, alone at 18 in a strange land. I had no idea what America was gonna be like. I felt lonely and terrified. I turned on the TV in the lounge in my dorm in Iowa, and the first thing I saw on TV in America was a masturbating bear. And I remember thinking, “I think I’m gonna like it here.” A lot of people will be talking about the masturbating bear, but nobody else has it as their literal introduction to America. It is a fitting introduction to America. To me, nothing represents America better than an unbelievably powerful predator pleasuring itself on television. [audience cheers, applauds] Today, Conan joins such luminaries as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bob Newhart, Adam Sandler, and Steve Martin, but the question is, does Conan deserve to be among these names? Does Conan deserve to receive the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor? This is the question we’ll tackle today during my Twain talk. All right. Okay, so let’s go through the categories that define comedic excellence and just see how the numbers stack up, okay? Category one, influence. Now, Conan was part of the writing staff of one of the most legendary and successful TV shows of all time, The Simpsons. People love to talk about Conan’s contributions to The Simpsons. In fact, his name gets brought up 93% of the time when people on the Internet talk about Simpsons writers. Let’s compare that to his actual contribution. Well, there are 781 episodes of The Simpsons. Conan wrote three. [audience laughs] You know what? Let’s zoom in, so we can see it a little bit more. Let’s zoom in a little bit more. There we go. That is a whopping 0.38%. By comparison, Charles Manson wrote 0.41% of the songs released by The Beach Boys. [audience laughs] Charles Manson is a bigger part of The Beach Boys than Conan is of The Simpsons. By the way, the names of The Simpsons episodes Conan wrote are, “Marge vs. the Monorail…” …and two other episodes. [laughter] To be fair, “Marge vs. The Monorail” tops lists of the best-ever episodes of The Simpsons, but at least Conan has not let that go to his head. Six-car monorail! What’d I say? That’s right, monorail! Let’s move on to the single most important thing in comedy, commitment. Now, comedy is about commitment, and nowhere is Conan’s commitment more obvious than when he is laughing at his guests. Between The Late Show, The Tonight Show, and Conan on TBS, Conan hosted a late-night show 4,381 times, and he laughed, on average, 193 times per episode. [audience laughing] Thanks to new AI technology, we can now determine that of those 193 laughs, around 2% were genuine. Let’s see now. Let’s watch a clip where Conan is genuinely laughing… [laughing persistently] And compare that to a random sample of Conan fake-laughing on his late-night show. I will never do another episode of Silicon Valley. [laughing] That’s really nice of you. [audience laughing] That’s the best clip the producers could find. Thanks so much, guys. Our last category is reputation. I could go on and on about what his colleagues and peers think of Conan, how much they admire his comedy and his work, how inspiring he has been to generations of comedians, but instead of that, I’m just going to talk to you about what you mean to me. Conan, you are my hero. You will genuinely never understand how important you are to me. Truly, truly, genuinely. I’ve tried to tell you this many times, and you changed the subject. I’m a comedian because of you. I really am. So after this, you’ll be FaceTiming my parents to apologize to them. [audience laughing] [cheering] I cannot think of anyone who deserves the Mark Twain Prize more than you. Thank you for having me. It has meant the absolute world to me. Thank you. [upbeat orchestral music plays] Most people do not know this about Conan, but a few years ago, he had a large growth removed, and he’s here tonight. Please welcome the beloved Andy Richter! [Andy] Thank you very much. Hi there. Hi, everybody. Boy, you can’t tell who the O’Briens are, can you? They made one mold and said that’ll be good for the whole run of them. Of all my marriages, the one that I had with Conan has lasted the longest. We first met in 1993, and when I was hired as a writer for Late Night, little did I know that it would turn into one million years as Conan’s sidekick. It was the beginning of my beginning, and I will always be grateful to Conan for inviting me into the process of making our funny, funny show. Uh, it’s a profoundly generous thing for a performer to let another performer sit next to them for years and share in the attention. When I think back to how our scrappy little show started, the way we got torn to shreds by critics in the early seasons, never knowing how long it would last, it’s gratifying to realize how far we’ve made it. I mean, you’re receiving the Mark Twain Prize, and I have one of the top five podcasts on the Team Coco network. No, no, please. Please, please. Thanks. Um, I am so proud to call you my friend and so happy to be here to see you accept this much-deserved award. Your commitment to putting the funniest, most intelligent stupidity out there has been there ever since the old days of Late Night, which is why I wanted to throw back to one of our old classic bits from the old show, because there’s a certain someone here who’d like to speak with you. Please welcome former President Bill Clinton. [mimicking President Clinton] Yee! Hi! Thanks, Andy! What’s up? Cone Zone! Whoa! Ah-ah! You know, Conan, I miss your show. I really do. Mostly because now there’s one less place for me to see Teri Hatcher. Awoo! [mimicking Schwarzenegger] Ah! Yes. I am also the one who is here. This is the first time they’ve given the award to someone who can’t even pick it up. Because you’re skinny and weakling, Conan. You got no muscle. Hasta la vista, Conan. It’s beloved film actor James Mason. Funny enough, dear heart, I’m down here in hell with the devil. He’s just pleased as punch… What’s happening? …that you’re receiving this award. He says you’ve got pluck, moxie, and several other things that I don’t feel comfortable repeating. Because we just don’t say those sorts of things about the Irish anymore. I couldn’t be on your show when I was alive. But now with recent developments in AI, we’re able to imagine what that might have looked like. In fact, we’ve got a clip. [in Mason’s voice] Take a look, my dear. [tense music plays] Eric! Wait. [tense music intensifies] [screams] Eric, stop! [Eric screaming] [audience laughs] Hi, Conan. Oh! Sorry, it’s just getting harder and harder to surprise you with that dumb clip. I just want to say how happy I am that you are the recipient of this year’s Mark Twain Prize for comedy. I think you’re the best. I love you, man, and congratulations. Oh… And keep doing what you do. Hm? The world needs it now more than ever. Deal? See you at the movies. [dramatic music resumes] Eric! Wait. Eric, stop! [Eric screaming] [orchestral music playing] Oh my God, that’s right. [announcer] You would not know this next guest is a Jew unless you read her name, saw her face, and heard her talk. Please welcomeSarah Silverman! [music fades] Outrageous. Experimental. Singular. A revelation. [clicks tongue] These are just some of the words used to describe my appearances on Conan. [audience laughs] Too easy a joke? Were you ahead of it? Yeah, maybe. Maybe. But what better way to celebrate our friend Conan O’Brien than without effort? The bits on Conan are legendary. They’re unmatched. So silly. So willing to experiment. They wrote a bit where Conan interviews Hitler, who comes on because he’s embarrassed that he’s being compared to Donald Trump. And they cast me as Hitler. [audience laughing] [chuckles] Yeah. Oh yeah. And now, you know, despite being able to grow an organically narrow mustache, I am actually, uh, not an obvious choice for Hitler. I mean, I am an obvious choice for Hitler, but I… [audience laughing] Not an obvious choice to play Hitler, uh… But they chose me, and it’s this way of thinking that makes Conan great again. [audience laughing] I just really miss the days when you were America’s only orange asshole. I… Oh, pace yourselves. I have loved Conan from the start of his first talk show. You know, in some ways, Conan and I came up together. His first year on the air was my first and last and only year on Saturday Night Live. And even after I lost my first and only job in show business, Conan kept having me on, like, all the time. Conan, the amount of creative freedom you have given me, and all the comics who have gone on your show, it’s been such a gift, uh… You’ve always trusted me to be my authentic self. Oh, remember when I came on, and I took that sideways picture of your mouth with my iPhone, you know, and then I put it between my legs, and as soon as I did, the network pixelated it. It was– Oh, yeah. It was– It was just a picture of your mouth. Like, that’s how much your mouth looks like a real vagina. [audience laughing] I mean… All those years of getting absolutely no vagina, and it was on your face the whole time, you know? It was like the end of The Wizard of Oz, or something. [audience laughing] Well, thankfully, tonight, we are on Netflix, so the world can finally see the stunning resemblance without any pixelation. Ladies and gentlemen, under your seats, you will find that very picture of Conan’s mouth. Now, if everyone can just go ahead and grab it. It really is under your seat, on the right. And… go ahead and put it right between your legs. If you could just kind of hold it. [audience laughing] What vagina do you have? It goes that way. Look at this sea of gorgeous vaginas. Absolutely stunning. Oh, Conan, your discomfort is my absolute joy, I have to say it. Tonight, your mouth speaks for everyone. As glorious, gender non-specific beef curtains of peace, here at The Kennedy Center. Thank you for giving so many so much joy over the years, and for giving every single person in this room beautiful ginger vulvas. [audience laughing] Your mouth may be a lipless vagina, but your comedy has real teeth. I love you, brother. Oh! Sorry, one more thing. Just, if you can… You can go ahead and leave those photos on your seat when you go. The guy who took over loves grabbing pussy. Good night! [lighthearted classical music playing] My name is Henfield Horgan. I’m the Dean of Students at Harvard University. [interviewer] Who is Conan O’Brien? Conan O’Brien, well, I’m told he was a student here, the youngest editor of the Harvard Lampoon. And, honestly, I mean this with no hyperbole, he attended Harvard University. [crowing] At Harvard, we aim to create titans of industry, finance, and government, you know, Henry Kissinger, people who made a tremendous and tangible difference in the world. What do you think? Creamy. [audience laughing] And, as a Harvard man, I assume that Conan upheld our standards. [laughter] Penis. Ask him if he can tell that I work out. [speaks in Korean] Oh yeah. [audience laughing] At Harvard, we expect our student body to have an air of dignity, respect, and effortless superiority. [majestic classical music playing] [music peaks, stops] Why not dig a trench? Then the ball would be as low as you seem to wish it to be. We expect our graduates to have a reverence for well-respected citizens of the upper class. You’re teaching people to be insane. You broke this boy. You broke his brain. Did you know that NBC has a Turkish spa? [lighthearted classical music plays] Yeah, isn’t that great? That is great. That would be nice. Yeah. Well, the only catch is you have to be completely naked. Well, that’s no problem. I mean, I’ll check it out. I think you’re gonna like it. Give me the robe. Just give me the robe. Get in there. [audience laughs] [audience laughs] [Henfield] Here at Harvard, we hold the cultures of the world in high esteem. I look like a Janet Jackson backup dancer. I’m here to buy your country. Yeah. When I’m walking around, I like to yell out random Italian things. You know? [speaks Italian] [speaks Japanese] You keep thinking it’s offensive. People just think that I’m Italian. Buongiorno. Harvard has generated eight U.S. presidents, 188 Nobel Laureates, and 48 Pulitzer Prize winners. [audience laughing] Let’s do this thing right now. [metallic clanking] What’s the name of the award again? [interviewer] The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Ah! Mark Twain, the riverboat captain. [audience laughs] Congratulations from all of us at the school. You’ve made us proud. You guys can write whatever you want, and I’ll sign it. That’s fine. [upbeat orchestral music playing] [announcer] Our next speaker didn’t get the Mark Twain Prize before the 2024 election, and now he never will. Please welcomeStephen Colbert! [audience cheers] Tonight, we gather to honor our friend Conan O’Brien. Of course, we all know Conan from his incredible career in late night, but in 2021, he walked away from his hilarious and, some would say, thought-provoking show. [audience laughing] Not many, but some. So far… So far, just me. Conan knew he had more worlds to conquer. He knew whatever came next had to be worthy of his talent, his legacy, his fierce intellect. So Conan went on Hot Ones. [audience laughing] If you have not seen Conan’s appearance on Hot Ones, just take out your phone right now and watch. I don’t mind. It’ll be funnier than anything we do up here tonight. I just wish that I somehow could recapture the courageous spirit that he displayed in that episode, but, I mean, what am I saying? That’s– That’s lightning in a bottle. Technically, the hot sauce was in the bottle. The lightning was shooting out of your ass, wasn’t it, Conan? There must be a way. [grandiose music plays] [man] Maybe I could help. Sean Evans of Hot Ones. Sean, what are you doing here? Stephen, you invited me. [laughter] And, Conan, you know, you walked onto the Hot Ones set as a self-proclaimed Irishman who’s never seen spice, and then, through your wing-by-wing dissension into madness, taught me, and the millions who watched, what show business really is. So tonight, we raise our milk glasses to you. Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen is going to attempt to continue his remarks while answering my questions and eating increasingly spicy chicken wings. Let’s bring it on! [clears throat] I’ll start by saying, in light of the new leadership at The Kennedy Center, all of these are right wings. [laughter] And a couple of them are truly insane. [audience laughing] Sean. We have five wings here, each hotter than the last. Okay, for context for the audience, how hot is Tabasco, Sean? About 1,000 Scoville units. What is the measurement on this first one here? More than 18 times that. Okay. That seems like a lot, Sean. Okay. Mmm. Mmm. Mm. So… [audience laughs] …how did you first meet Conan? Well, I met Conan when I was a member of The Second City in Chicago. I was… It was right before Conan took over for Letterman, and he was looking for writers. So Robert Smigel, Robert Smigel said he was going to bring Conan to see me in the show at Second City, and I was so excited. And– This is the first wing. [audience laughing] That’s not great. Okay, anyway… I was super psyched, and I really dug down deep, and I gave the performance of a lifetime, because I knew I had to, because Conan O’Brien was out there. So, what did he think? I don’t know. He wasn’t out there. He never showed up. He had a thing. Next wing. Come on. Ticktock. All right, moving on. This is Los Calientes Rojo with a Scoville rating of 49,000. Okay. Whoopedeedoo! So, was it then that you gave up on working on Conan’s show? No, I did not give up. At one point, I even flew to New York and sat outside of his office door in 30 Rock, hoping to catch his eye as he came out of a meeting. He never came out. Now, I know that sounds sad, but I want everyone to know it also looks sad. [audience laughing] And then you gave up? No. I submitted multiple writer’s packets. I never heard back. But you know what? That’s all in the past, Sean. I’m not a man who holds grudges. So tonight, I just want to say, Conan, what did you think of my packet? [audience laughing] Did you ever read it? Did you ever–? Because I brought it. Do you have anything that reads floppies? I have it. I’m not joking. [sighs heavily and chuckles] [coughs] This was a bad idea. Are you okay, Stephen? No, it’s just really beginning to hit me. No, that we’re at The Kennedy Center. Okay. [grunting, coughing] If you can gather yourself, let’s move on to the next wing. All right. This one right here, 131,000 Scoville units. Yeah, okay, here we go. Mm. Mmm. All right. Mm. Mmm. So, Stephen, it seems like Conan’s opinion still means a lot to you. Of course it does. It’s Conan fucking O’Brien. I’ll have you know, he was the only two-time president of the Harvard Lampoon. Do you know what that means? No, what does that mean? I don’t know. But it’s on his Wikipedia page, so someone cares. Let’s keep going. Wing me, bitch. Let’s go. So, this is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity. It’s a turning point in the show, and a sauce you know all too well. If you’re ready. Let’s go, Stephen. Okay. Let’s go. Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Amazing. [laughs] [audience laughing] What do you admire about Conan? Well, what’s not to admire? Oh, this one really sucks. Yeah. [audience laughing] [Stephen grunting] [audience laughing, cheering] Whoo! [grunts] Everything… [clears throat] …not only is Conan a brilliant comedian, he gives everything he’s got to every bit he ever does. You know that extra gear that sometimes, a couple times in your life, you have to dig down and find? That’s Conan’s only gear. When Conan commits to something, he never backs down. Case in point, when he accepted the Mark Twain Prize, this was a very different place. [audience laughing] Today, they announced two board members, Bashar al-Assad and Skeletor, but this man… [Stephen grunting] All for you, Conan. Okay, Stephen. We’ve made it to the final wing. God, make it end, Sean! Make it end! This is the last dab. This is a Scoville rating of 2,693,000 units. You’re just making shit up now. Final question, let’s go. All right, so, this is a big question. Who is Conan O’Brien? Conan O’Brien is pound for pound the funniest person on Earth to spend time with. When he’s on a roll, nothing better. When he’s not on a roll, he will not stop until he finds a roll. Conan will never leave a room until he gets a big, real, genuine laugh, which makes him amazing at parties and not so great at funerals. [audience laughing] Speaking of funerals, I’m pretty sure mine is imminent. Sean, thank you so much for doing this. Conan, I admire you, I learn from you, and I love you almost as much as I hate Sean right now. To Conan O’Brien. You’re my hero. [grunts] [upbeat orchestral music plays] [announcer] Your next presenter is so successful that he pays for all his abortions in cash. Please welcomeTracy Morgan! Good evening, Kennedy Center. Tonight, we honor a dude that has been an incredible friend to me. He and I have led remarkably similar lives. He worked on SNL for years, I worked on SNL for years. He had a show on NBC for years, I had a show on NBC for years. He graduated Valedictorian from Harvard, I had a show on NBC for years. Conan interviewed me over 50 times on his show, and every single time was incredible. His show was always much fun. Conan and I bonded immediately ’cause we both grew up dreaming about being on television. I used to stay inside and watch television because I lived in the projects in the Bronx, and I didn’t want to get shot. [audience laughing] Conan, on the other hand, would stay inside and watch TV because he wasn’t allowed to go out in the sun. I’m not exaggerating. I truly, truly love Conan. You mean much to me, man. All he and I want to do is make people laugh. That’s what bonds us. It doesn’t matter what color we are, Black, brown, white, or whatever color he is. [audience laughing] I have a daughter, and for one of her birthdays, I got her Crayola crayons, 150-pack, and Conan’s color is not in there. It doesn’t exist in nature. [audience laughing] Conan, I appreciate all the comedy magic we’ve made over the years. You’re an absolute giant in the world of comedy, and I consider you my brother. And after a lifetime of making us laugh, whether it was on SNL or The Simpsons, you, of all people, deserve to finally receive tonight’s J.D. Power and Associates Award for Best Mid-Size Sedan. [audience laughing, cheering] I love you, C-Boogie. [cheering] Conan to comedy is like rock and roll. You want to be a part of that rock and roll. I’ve never seen him do anything hacky. When he hosted the Oscars, the opening monologue was brilliant, and it’s a really thankless job, and it takes a lot of guts to do that job. I thought he did such a great job. [man] I’m going to pitch Dave & Buster’s next door. Conan feeds his meter. That’s you two, just as– Hey! [jazz music plays] [laughter] All right, let’s go over the Oscar team. I asked you to memorize all the notes. [man] Of course. The writers’ room is this very weird, surreal place where somehow people get paid to say and write funny things that eventually might sell Volkswagen ads. [woman] I laugh my ass off every day. It’s just chaos. [in a funny voice] I love it when you guys write material because I feast like a king! [laughter] No idea is going to get by Conan that isn’t exceptional. There’s so many ways this can go that we should just generate a bunch of possibilities. And then see which one we like the most. The only way to solve it is get the one where we all go, “That’s funny.” Instead of doing stand-up, he found himself in these writers’ rooms, and he would just kind of take over and perform for them. Dana Carvey said something on one of the last episodes of the TBS show, which is, “You went from the funniest man in the writers’ room to the funniest man in America.” Jesus, what a fucking ass! [writer] Did you guys see when he was like so racist? [orchestral music playing] [announcer] Please welcome an outstanding actor who for eight years portrayed a man who thought carpool karaoke was funny, Mr.Reggie Watts!

Thank you very much. Um, Conan chose me to be his opening act on his one and only, who knows, maybe there’ll be another one, uh, live tour. Uh, he stays grounded, was always joking with everybody, took the time to hang out with me inside my room, and I was like, “Wow, this guy knows how to do it.” “He knows how to live life, and stay grounded, connected to his fans.” Uh, thank you for taking the time to trust me and have good instincts, and… [voice shakes] …for really just kind of like showing me, being crazy and being who you are, and being grounded, and not letting that affect you your entire career. That’s incredibly important, and that’s a good lesson for all artists. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much, Conan. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Kennedy Center. Stay Kennedy. [upbeat orchestral music playing] [announcer] Our next presenter has made over $3 billion at the box office and spent it all on his wardrobe at Foot Locker. Give it up forAdam Sandler! Yeah, Triumph! Good evening. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Hello to all the Kennedys, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, and finely-dressed seat fillers. My name is Adam Sandler, and here is your cue to go nuts. Let’s fucking go. Come on now. I appreciate that. Respect. Respect. Thank you. I have one simple favor to ask of you quietly rich people tonight. When I point at you with my left hand, you say the word “Conan.” Let’s try it out right now. Another time. Conan! Now let the festivities begin. We are gathered here tonight in our nation’s capital to honor one man. Conan! When I received this prestigious Mark Twain prize two years ago, I figured they were done giving them out, but I guess not because of a dude named… Conan! Eight-foot four inches and counting. Puts on sunscreen before he lights a candle. Conan! Went to Harvard, but never brings it up except when arguing with his wife, Liza. Looks like if one of the Little Rascals grew up in Chernobyl. So Irish, his nipples are shaped like four-leaf clovers. Conan! So Irish, his skid marks taste remarkably like shamrock shakes. Bright red hair was the true cause of the Palisades fire. Stayed in his mama’s womb for a record-breaking tummy stretch at 14 ERs. Has pubic hair that makes his dick look like Ed Sheeran. Has pubic hair that makes his dick look like Pennywise. In the summer has so many freckles on his– In the summer, has so many freckles on his dick that it looks like Ron Howard is hugging Tom Sawyer. Mark Twain reference. Has 12 Kids’ Choice Awards and 15 MTV Awards. Nope, that’s actually the Sandman. In fact, if I point with my right hand from now on, let’s say “Sandman.” Let’s try that out quickly. Sandman! Okay, now let’s move forward. Takes his shirt off, and all the ladies swoon. Takes his shirt off, and the skin comes with it. Conan! Famous… …famous for wearing long, silky basketball shorts. Famous for having long fuzzy balls hang out his tighty-whities. Gets mistaken for a young James Caan. Gets mistaken for one of them giant blow-up thingies outside a car dealership. Conan! Incredible actor. Incurable acne. Conan! Can walk in and get a table at any restaurant in the world. Can walk in and get a table at Panda Express in the mall if he gets there a half hour early. And to be honest, on Fridays it’s still iffy. Has his handprints on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Has his uncle’s handprints on his ass. Conan! Can grow a full beard in three hours flat. Spent three months on a beard only for his kids to say, “Dad, did you just eat some Flamin’ Hot Cheetos?” Conan! Phone number is 917-664-765… Call him whenever you want, the later the better. Comedic genius. Sandman! Comedic penis. Finally, is married to a gorgeous woman way out of his league. Sandman and Conan! Yes, that is the both of us. Love you, Liza. Love you, Jackie. Thank you for the charity work. But, seriously, Conan, this is the nice part. You’re one of the funniest guys, we all know that. I remember when Lorne, you know, was in charge of finding the next host. And right when they said Conan, I swear to God, every fucking guy, every comedian, there was no jealousy. We were like, “Fuck yeah, he’s the best, man.” You’re faster than all of us, you’re nicer than all of us, and I’m so happy this life was yours, buddy. It’s awesome. Uh… You bring out the best of us, Conie. I’m glad to know you, glad to know your great family. I love you all. And I’m glad the world loves you as much as I do. Long live… Conan! [upbeat orchestral music playing] Oh yes, our final guest, who’d be in Indiana right now, shoveling horse shit, but he chose to be here with Conan, please welcome the one, the only,David Letterman! [upbeat orchestral music playing] Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Uh, you have to learn something as you grow in life. And this evening, and forgive me, this is my takeaway, and maybe I’m late to this party, but the thing that I’ve learned now, there’s something surprising, uh, not unpleasant, and awkwardly appealing about a certain part of Conan’s face. I just learned that. And then I heard freckles on his dick, so I had to come right out. Uh, the Mark Twain Prize. Oh my God, let me just say one thing, and I’m not a historian, but I believe that history will show, this will have been the most entertaining gathering of the resistance ever. I just want to say a couple of things. Yes, I could have been in Indiana, shoveling shit. Now is just about the time of year when you get most of your shit-shoveling done. But I said, no, I’d rather be here with Conan than shovel shit, and I stand by that, ladies and gentlemen. We’re here tonight to honor a writer, performer, and fierce climate denier, Conan O’Brien. I believe there is no one better suited for the Mark Twain Prize than Conan O’Brien, because like Mark Twain, Conan is first and foremost a writer. Also like Mark Twain, Conan once tricked me into painting his fence. People… [chuckles] Of everyone in the room tonight, I’m confident in saying this. I believe I’m the one who looks most like Mark Twain… …looks now. Our honoree is not only a talk show host, he was a writer for SNL and The Simpsons, he’s hosted travel shows and the Academy Awards. Conan, what is it like to be asked to host the Academy Awards a second time? You know, when Conan was chosen to be the host of Late Night, everyone was asking, “Well, who is this guy?” “How did he get this show? Why is he so pale? Is he sickly?” [laughter] “Is he getting enough vitamin C?” “Is he an abnormally tall child, or a normal-sized man that looks like a child?” “Is he anemic?” Well, with previews like that, I, of course, had to tune into the show, and when I watched Conan on the Late Night program, what I saw was a very funny show. Uh, they took great risks. The comedy was peculiar in the best way. It was silly, absurd, and smart. All of which, not an easy combination. In those days, there was nothing like it on television. Here now is the moment I knew firsthand that Conan was a great choice to be the host of Late Night. I want to ask you something. This is a question that people wouldn’t expect, but when I first got this job, I came here to 30 Rock. How did you get this job, by the way? [audience laughing] Was it a theme-writing contest? Yeah. It was a what-would-I-do-with-a-talk-show, and I was fourth. Uh… That’s right. “I was fourth.” That’s when I knew the kid was the real deal. Conan is now no longer, in his own words, the guy who shouldn’t be here. He is the guy we are honoring tonight with the Mark Twain Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome The Interrupter, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, the FedEx Pope, the masturbating bear, and Jordan Schlansky. Now, it is a true honor to present the 26th Mark Twain Prize for American Humor to our good friend,Conan O’Brien. Conan. [upbeat orchestral entrance music playing] [inaudible] [music continues] [music stops] [Conan] Thank you. Thank you very much. Please. Um… To be… [woman] I love you, Conan! I love you too, sir. Uh… [audience laughing] To be handed this award by David Letterman is, uh, to be honest, very hard for me to comprehend. And I need to put this in context, so you will understand. The year is 1987, and I’m living in Los Angeles. I’m only two years out of college, and I’m unemployed. My partner Greg and I had just lost our first job writing for television, and I am sitting alone in a Du-par’s diner on Wilshire Boulevard, eating pancakes very slowly at one in the afternoon to try and fill out the entire day. My burning ambition… [clears throat] …I believe my destiny, is to write for Dave’s Late Night show. And I have just heard from their head writer that the only open slot has already been filled, and there will be no job. Feels like a steel door had come down. I had no idea what is gonna become of me. Now imagine that suddenly some angel from the future appears and tells me that 40 years from now I’m gonna be on stage at The Kennedy Center in Washington, and that the most prestigious award in comedy is gonna be handed to me by David Letterman. I would have stared at that angel in utter shock and said, “Wait a minute.” “David Letterman is still alive?” [laughter] “Forty years from now?” [audience laughing] “He’s 20 years older than me!” “God, how does he look?” [audience laughing] The angel would say, “He’s got a beard.” I’d say, “Is it trim and fashionable?” Angel would say, “No! It’s really white and crazy long.” “Imagine if Dostoevsky was panhandling for gold in the Yukon.” [audience laughing] What are you doing, man? So you have to understand that what just transpired for me was an Oppenheimer at Los Alamos moment. And before I go any further, I have to give thanks first to my parents who missed witnessing this by three months. They would have absolutely loved this. Uh, to my beautiful and talented wife, Liza. And– Yes. And to my patient and perpetually unimpressed children, Neve and Beckett, who are so much smarter than me. They honestly don’t get it, and they’re not wrong. [audience laughing] I wanna thank this band, Max Weinberg and The Max Weinberg 7. I wanna thank all the insanely generous and talented speakers who flew to D.C. on my behalf for this evening. I will never recover from this. It is what my people call a mitzvah and I… My people borrow stuff we like, uh… And a special thanks to all the beautiful people who have worked here at The Kennedy Center for years, and who are worried about what the future might bring. My eternal thanks for their selfless devotion to the arts. And I think we should all… That was plenty, uh… There are so many, many people to thank, and this is always where these speeches go south, because you have to thank all these people. You have to. It’s the rule. But then it takes forever. So I had an idea to thank everyone as quickly as possible. Please welcome professional livestock auctioneer Robert Strickler. Let’s get him out here. [fast-paced] Thank you, Neil, Luke, Kate, and Jane O’Brien. They were here from the beginning. Monty for the Reardons, Lorne Michaels, Mike Sweeney, Jeff Ross, Robert Smigel, Greg Daniels, Sona Movsesian. At my lowest, they lifted me up. Amy Lippman, Rodman Flender, Rick Ludwin, Rick Rosen, Gavin Polone, Ari Emanuel, Lee Brecken. They believed in me when I didn’t. Sarah Wicks, Paula Davis, Steve Coogan, Lisa Kudrow, Aaron, and Judy Daniels, Jonathan Groff, Bob Odenkirk didn’t help, but is recognizable. Matt O’Brien, David Hopping, Adam Sachs, Nina Rosenstein, Erica Brown, Jason Klamm, Andy Richter was my rock, by my side. Mike Reese, Al Jean, Jeff Martin, Sam Simon, Matt Groening, James Brooks, Pat Lee, Don Moffitt, Bob and Ginny, Monty Python, Warner Bros. cartoons, Pink Panther movies. Words can’t express how much you mean, I’ll owe them all my eternal gratitude. And finally, two-year-old, 1,200-pound Guernsey heifer. She’s been with me from the beginning. 3,000, 3,500. I’m… [talks gibberish] Forty-five, 5,000. I’m… [talks gibberish] Six thousand, 6,500. I’m… [talks gibberish] …seventy-five. [talks gibberish] Sold it. In the back there, 7,500. I think accepting an award named after Mark Twain, uh, is a responsibility. One cannot invoke Twain without understanding who he was and what he stood for. Now, don’t be distracted by the white suit and the cigar and the riverboat. Twain is alive, vibrant, and vitally relevant today. Yes, he is America’s greatest humorist, but his enduring power springs from his core principles, principles that shaped his comedy and made him one of our greatest Americans. First and foremost, Twain hated bullies. He populated his works with abusers, such as Huck Finn’s alcoholic father, Tom Driscoll in Pudd’nhead Wilson, and he made his readers passionately hate those characters. He punched up, not down, and he deeply, deeply empathized with the weak. Twain… Twain! Twain was allergic to hypocrisy, and he loathed racism. Twain wrote, “There are many humorous things in the world, among them the white man’s notion that he is less savage than the other savages.” Twain empathized with the powerless in America, former slaves struggling in Reconstruction, immigrant Chinese laborers in California, and European Jews fleeing anti-Semitism. Twain’s remedy for ignorance about the world around us was to travel at a time when travel was very long and very difficult. Twain circled the globe, and he wrote, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.” Twain… Twain was suspicious of populism, jingoism, imperialism, the money-obsessed mania of the Gilded Age, and any expression of mindless American might or self-importance. Above all, Twain was a patriot in the best sense of the word. He loved America, but knew it was deeply flawed. Twain wrote, “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.” Now… Some of you… Some of you might think, what does this have to do with comedy? It has everything to do with comedy. Everything. The comedy I have loved all my life, comedy that is self-critical, deflating, and dedicated to the proposition that we are all flawed, absurd, and wallowing in the mud together. Twain is funny and important today because his comedy is a hilarious celebration of our fears, our ineptitude, and the glorious mess of being human. When we celebrate Twain, truly see him for who he was, we acknowledge our commonality, and we move just a little closer together. So I accept this award in the spirit of humility, stupidity, inanity, irrelevance, fear, self-doubt, and profound, unceasing silliness. I thank you. It’s the honor of a lifetime. Thank you so much. And… You know… Thank you. I’m going to… Always get out on a standing ovation, but not this time. I said it once. I said Twain’s alive and well, and I mean it. Mark Twain, I love you. [in period accent] And I love you, Conan O’Brien. My God, it’s Mark Twain! Well, sour belly on a biscuit, you bet it’s Mark Twain. Been watching this Twain Prize Ceremony for 30 years from up in the tree. You’re the only recipient to really deserve this honor. You can’t mean that, Mr. Twain. Oh, you bet your bippy I mean it, Conan. And all the past winners are clowns. [laughter] Will Farrell is a buffoon. [audience laughing] If his eyes were any closer together, he’d be a damn cyclops. Adam Sandler can’t read. He can’t. Got halfway through a pop-up book and filled his pants like a two-year-old. Kevin Hart shot a credit card commercial during his acceptance speech. Wait a minute. I am not going to stand here and listen to you insult these great comedians, Mr. Twain. Why? You wrote this sketch, Conan. I’m just reading it word for word. That’s not true. You wrote that too. [laughter] Look, I’m a cutting bait on your script, and I’m speaking from my own mind. My point is, comedy is about the weak and the absurd, and that describes you, Conan O’Brien. You’re a translucent man-child who has bumbled and stumbled through 30 years of meaningless spasmodic idiocy and somehow, against all odds, you have landed here like a soggy cork washing up on a lonely beach. [audience laughing] You know, that’s harsh medicine, Mr. Twain, but I guess that’s… I guess that’s what I’ve always admired about you. Well, times change, but people have to stay resolute, and I appreciate those words you said about me earlier. You got grit, son, and even though that’s a line you wrote for me to say… [audience laugh] I do so mean it. Well, coming from you, that means… that means the world to me. I… I really do love you, Mr. Twain. I love you too, Conan O’Brien. [nostalgic orchestral music playing] All right, that’s it. No more. Stop, no good. No, we can’t. That’s not how we’re ending it. We can’t do it like that. You were very good, Forte, though. Ladies and gentlemen, this man can play guitar. Don’t we wanna see the man jam a little bit? Yeah!

    "transcript":"Cristela Alonzo: Middle Classy (2022) | Full transcript All right. Are you ready to get this thing going? Cristela, do you know how I met Senator Robert Kennedy? Oh, well, we had registered 140,000 voters in California. No way. How’s everybody doing? I found out he was gonna be at the Coronado Hotel in San Diego. And so I went to the Coronado Hotel… My name is Joaquin Castro. That was the first time that I ever met Robert Kennedy. That’s how you met? My day job is in Congress. And then, there’s another story about… Uh, Dolores, I– I’m running late. So I’m gonna go. But I’ll be right back. I want you to hear this other story. I wanna hear it. I wanted to do something more respectable with my life. So here I am. Opening up for Cristela. I love your stories. I know. Like, “Whoa. History. Wow, wow.” It’s like sí se pudo, right? Yeah, right. Like, hold that thought. I’ll be right back. You… Yeah, I’m gonna be waiting for you. Yeah, of course! All right! All right! Give a huge welcome to my badass friend from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, Cristela Alonzo! Yes! Oh! Oh! Look at us! Ah! We made it! This time last year, we were all grounded by God. And look at us. Now we’re out here saying, “Look at us! We’re still alive.” It’s amazing. Hey, man, I didn’t know if we were gonna make it or not. We started out with COVID-19, now we’re up to COVID-24. I swear to God, COVID has become likeStar Wars. You know, every couple months, there’s a new one out. Like, “Oh, man! Omicron’s out? I haven’t finished seeing The Mandalorian yet.” Like, what? It didn’t have to be like this, either. It didn’t have to be like this. It didn’t have to be so hard. I grew up watching scary movies. Now, I love zombie movies, right? And there’s always that scene, yeah, where you find out, “Oh my God, they’re zombies.” And it’s never just one zombie. It’s, like, 30 zombies. And I would watch that scene in every movie and think, “That’s unrealistic.” “How would they let it get so bad?” Right? ‘Cause if I ever see one zombie, I’m killing the zombie. But to get to 30? How do we do that? Then I started thinking, “Ah, you know why?” It’s because we never showed that scene in the movie where the assholes are walking around, like, “It’s my right to get bit by a zombie.” Ooh. “It’s my right as an American to get bit by a zombie.” You’re not supposed to pick how you die, stupid. What is that? All of these past couple of years, it’s just been so much. I had to spend the lockdown in LA, and I hated it. ‘Cause I came from a very close family. Like, this is the first time I had to do something without my family. You know? And it was hard. My family, we’re from South Texas, you know? We’re from Mexico. And… um. That’s South Texas. It’s South Texas. It’s kinda South Texas. It’s like South Texas. I grew up in a mixed-status family. If you don’t know what that is, that means half of us were documented, half of us were undocumented, and we’re not telling you which one’s which. Guess what? We all look alike! We didn’t have a lot of money growing up. You know? We had to share a bathroom and a birth certificate. It sucked. My brother Cristela hated it. It’s okay. It’s okay. Spanish is my first language. I learned English later on in life. I was actually an ESL kid growing up. And, um… I had to learn English… ¿Ustedes también? I had to learn English by watching TV shows like The Price Is Right. You know? And, white people, you messed with me. “Plinko” is not a real word. Screw you. I trusted you. I used to learn your words, and I’d incorporate it in everyday life. “I can’t go today. I feel plinko.” Turns out it wasn’t a real word. I love that word. I wanna name my kids Plinko. ‘Cause that sounds Mexican. Plinko, ven pa ca. I thought I could name my kids Plinko because I grew up in the hood. And sometimes in the hood, we’ll name our kids fucked-up shit. Sometimes we’ll name our kids things we want out of life. You know? Like, “Yo, that’s my daughter, Mercedes. What’s up? How you doing?” “That’s my son, Paid Water Bill. How you doing? Come say hi. Come say hi.” “Where’s Cable? Anyone seen Cable?” So that’s how I learned to speak English. I would sit in front of the TV and I would just watch the shows and just repeat everything I heard, you know? Like, the voices, the accents. So, in my family, I’m the only one that doesn’t have a super thick Mexican accent. You know? My brother, my oldest brother, he was born and raised in Mexico. And he’s got that stereotypical accent, you know? Like… Like if a taco could talk. Like, if Edward James Olmos met him, he would wanna teach him “calculus.” You know? Like… Right? “You need ganas.” So it was always weird, because we grew up together but it always sounded like we weren’t related, right? ‘Cause my brother’s like, “Hey, sister.” “Nah, pues, you wanna go get something to eat or what?” I’m like, “Well, we could do that.” “Or would you like to see what’s behind door number three? Come on down!” You know? Eh, when you think about it, by the way, Price Is Right is not a game show for poor people. ‘Cause we don’t know the price of any brand-name stuff at all. We buy generic. I grew up on the Dollar Store. That’s me on The Price Is Right. “How much is that orange juice?” “Ninety-nine cents.” “How much is that mac and cheese?” “Oh, no, too much. Put it back.” Now, as an adult, though, I speak three languages. I speak Spanish, English, and Caucasian. No, Caucasian is like English, but I have to use fancy words I don’t normally use, like “organic” and “deductible.” Let me give you an example. Like, in my everyday life, when my friends mess up, I’m like, “Bitch, you fucked up.” But in Caucasian, I’m like, “Ma’am, that is unacceptable.” See? A little right there? A little… “I will fuck you up!” “Let me speak to the manager.” I grew up in a border town right next to Mexico in South Texas. And I always think it’s interesting, one thing we never talk about a lot is how so many of us grew up in bubbles. You know what I mean? If you’re a small town, even in a big city, if your neighborhood doesn’t have a lot of diversity, you don’t know better. Right? ‘Cause you’re a kid. That’s not our fault. I always say, though, when you become an adult and you go out into the world, and you start meeting people you didn’t know about or like, you weren’t familiar with, the cultures, it’s your job to learn about them and evolve. That’s what we have to do, right? But it’s hard. It’s hard at first. You know? In my border town, we had no diversity. Meaning, like, we were all Mexican. Like, everybody in my neighborhood was Mexican. We used to call each other “Mexican.” Like, “What’s up, Mexican?” “How you doing, Mexican?” “Mexican!” Like, you know? Then I went to college in St. Louis, Missouri. Someone warn a bitch. I wasn’t ready for what I was gonna meet. Like, you know, just different kinds of people. Like, again, we were all Mexican, right? Even when I saw people on TV, it didn’t seem real, ’cause TV felt so far away from where I grew up, right? So, I was in St. Louis, first day of college, this guy comes up to me, ends up being my best friend, right? He’s like, “Hey, what’s up? I’m Byron.” And immediately, I’m like, “Ah, Mexican!” “You’re the darkest Mexican I’ve ever met!” And he was like, “I’m Black.” I was like, “Oh. Oh.” I wasn’t familiar. Same thing with white people. I didn’t realize white people came in such different shades. There’s like white and white. Like, there’s white, and I’m like, “Are you haunting me?” “Do you go here, or do you have a message from my dead mother?” But I didn’t know I was gonna meet other people that grew up in bubbles, too. That threw me off. Right? My freshman year, my roommate, she was from Tennessee. She hadn’t met a Latina before. Oh. Mmm. No one in her family had. Her mom was with her to drop her off, right? Her mom, uh, wasn’t sure if I spoke English. We had been talking all day. So I don’t know what she thought, like maybe I was just gonna forget, run out of English, halfway through the day, you know? Like, “Hey, how are you?” “Oh, I’m doing pretty good.” “Are you sure?” “No, yeah, no, no. No. Trial expired. Upgrade? No. Out of order.” “No.” So my roommate’s mom decides she’s going to invite me out to dinner with them. But she’s going to act out all the words. To make sure I understood. So she was making it up as she went along, right? So she was like, “Hi. So… I was wondering if you… wanted to go with us to eat Italian.” Like, why the fuck is this Italian? “Do you know what Italian is?” Like, “Dude, I play Super Mario Brothers. Yeah, I know… Yes. I know what Italians are. I know the national anthem. That ‘doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!'” “The flag is right there. Yeah. Salute. All Italians are plumbers. Let’s go!” So I said yes ’cause I had never eaten Italian. My mom was a Mexican cook at a Mexican restaurant. We only ate Mexican food growing up. Like, I had no idea, but I wanted to see what this Italian food was. So I said, “Yes.” And my roommate’s mom took us to this dope place called “Olive-a Garden.” If you guys didn’t laugh, it’s because you don’t speak Italian. And that’s okay. I don’t judge you, but get some culture. So we were at “Olive-a Garden.” And we’re eating the never-ending breadsticks and salads, you know? Like they do in Italy. Right? You know how the salads come with “peppercinis”? They kinda look like jalapeños, but like, not at all? It’s kinda like when you see a white guy with dreads and you’re like, “Not at all.” Right? Right? Yeah? Yeah. So my roommate’s mom sees the first “peppercini” and, like, loses it. ‘Cause she thinks it’s a moment to bond with me. I’m not kidding. Like, this woman wants to give it to me as a gift. She looks at it and she’s like… Grabs a fork, stabs one, looks at me, and says… “I know who wants this.” She was so excited. Like, I didn’t know how she wanted me to react. You know? Like… “Thank you, lady!” “Olive Garden para siempre!” I was 18 years old. It was the first day outside of Texas for me. No one had ever talked to me like that. Like, I didn’t know what to think, I didn’t know how to react. Like, part of me was so mad, I wanted to be like, “Hey, you racist bitch!” Right? But I wanted it. “Hey, you racist, but accurate, bitch! Bring it here!” I told my friend that story recently. He’s like, “Why are you mad? That happened, like, two decades ago.” And I was like, “‘Cause I just realized it was fucked up now.” Right? Sometimes you look back at your life and the shit that was cool, you’re like, “That was fucked up.” But we didn’t know it was messed up, because back then it was okay. It was acceptable. But see, that’s the thing. We have to learn that, throughout time, there’s certain things you can’t do anymore. It’s not okay. Like when people are like, “I can’t say that word anymore?” Guess what? You never should’ve. Guess what? Not supposed to. It’s just that now, we have access to tell you, like, “Hey! Don’t.” Honestly, like, for me, when I look back, I wanted everybody to like me. I would do things I didn’t wanna do because I wanted to be cool. And if they didn’t like me, I always thought it was my fault. “What did I do wrong? How do I fix it?” Then in my thirties, I started thinking, “I don’t think I like you people.” “You guys might be the problem.” Now, in my forties, I’m like, “Fuck everybody! I got plants to water.” And that’s it. Love it. Love it. I love it. I love getting older. The older I get, the less I care. I just had a birthday. I turned 43. Amazing. I love it. You know what I like about it? At 43, I’m not old, but I’m not young. Right in the middle. I kinda feel like I’m an iPhone 6. Yeah. I know I’m not the newest phone out there, but guess what, I’m affordable and I get the job done. Like, that’s me. Dating me is like dating an iPhone 6. Like, yes, the younger women have a longer battery life. On Saturday nights, they’re like, 30 in the morning, “Fuck it! Let’s do it! Wooh!” “Forty-seven percent!” No. Me, I’m an iPhone 6. 30, I’m like, “One percent. Shutting down. Leave me by the wall.” Seriously. I just got overCOVID, you know? Sounds like we’re breaking up. “I got over COVID.” It was weird. I still can’t smell and taste a lot of stuff. It was wild. You know? It knocked me out. Now, here’s the thing. I tested positive for COVID on my birthday. I know. That’s a bad way to celebrate your birthday, right? Like, “Happy birthday,” right? It was tough. Now, let me tell you, my birthday’s on January 6. So… I was sick. Everybody told me, like, “Take care of yourself. Rest, rest, rest.” Blah, blah. And I’m like, “Yes.” So, finally, I was like, “Okay. I’ve got COVID. I’m gonna take it easy.” I get a phone call. From my apartment manager. And he’s like, “Hey, Cristela.” “LAPD’s here, and they wanna talk to you.” And I was like, “Oh, shit. Is that what they do to people with COVID? Like… Oh, my God.” Like, it would be a brown woman, right? Like… So they were like, “No, you know, there’s a guy that’s been stealing packages around the neighborhood, and we found a package with your name on it. And they didn’t open it. So we need you to open the box so that you can tell the cops how much everything is. Because after a certain amount, it becomes a felony. So we need to know if this guy’s gonna be, like, charged with a felony. Can you come down?” And I’m like, “Yeah!” I hang up, and I’m like, “Nah, bitch, you got COVID.” Right? So I call up my apartment manager and I tell him, and he’s like, “Okay, well, how about this? What if the LAPD comes up to you? They’ll be wearing masks. They’ll stand at the end of the hallway. They’ll drop off the box. You can open it and just yell how much… everything is to the LAPD.” Right? I’m like, “Yeah, that sounds good. Let’s do this.” Right? So, LAPD comes to my place. They drop the– they drop the box. They’re at the end of the hallway. They’re wearing masks and stuff. My apartment manager’s there. And I realize I can’t open the box with my hands, right? Now, you know how when you need scissors, you can’t find scissors? You’re like… when you don’t need them, “Oh, scissors everywhere,” right? You know what I mean? So, I needed to open the box. I couldn’t find anything, so I went to the kitchen and I got a knife. Yes. So now, I’m like, “I brought a knife!” My next-door neighbor opens, and she’s like, “Oh, shit.” I’m like, “You go inside.” Like, you know what I mean? Like… So I open the box, and I see it’s a black box, and it has, like, a Netflix ribbon on it. Right? And the cop, immediately, he’s like, “Is that Netflix?” “I got Netflix. They don’t give me shit.” “Why Netflix giving you stuff?” And I was like, “Oh, I’m a comic. I’m doing a special for them. I heard they were gonna give me a birthday gift. So I think this is the gift.” And he’s like, “What is it?” I was like, “I don’t know. Let me check!” So I open the box, and it’s a blanket. Like a really nice blanket, right? And I’m like, “It’s a blanket!” And the cop’s like, “A blanket? Netflix is a billion-dollar company. They gave you a blanket? Damn!” Right? And I instantly tell him, like, “Well, we’re not dating. I’m not fucking Netflix!” He’s like, “How much is that blanket?” I’m like, “I don’t know. It’s a gift!” He’s like, “Look for the brand!” I’m like, “Okay.” And I look for the brand. And I give him the brand. And he’s like, “Hold up. I’m gonna google it.” And he googles it. And he’s like, “The blanket’s $179!” And I was like, “I didn’t need to know that. It’s a birthday gift.” And he was like, “Is there anything else? There better be something else.” And I’m like, “I don’t know. Let me look!” So I go inside the box and there’s a candle. And I’m like, “Oh, it’s a candle!” And he’s like, “Well, how much are candles?” I’m like, “Uh, they vary, from, like, $5 to, like, $95. It just depends. They’re really nice.” He’s like, “Well, what’s the brand?” I’m like, “Hold on, let me look!” So I give him the brand, and he googles it. He’s like, “It’s $90. What? Ninety dollars? That’s more than half a blanket!” And he’s, like, telling his partner, “All right. So it’s $179 and it’s $90. Let’s add it up.” Blah, blah, blah. And he’s like… “Oooh… We got a felony. We got a felony.” He’s all excited. Like I’m in the middle of a really fucked-up game show, right? Like, “Is It a Felony?” “Yes, it is.” So… I’m like, “What now?” He’s like, “Okay, now I need your info.” “What’s your name?” I’m like, “Cristela Alonzo.” He’s like, “What’s your birthday?” I was like, “January 6!” And he’s like… “That’s today! Wait, you got COVID on your birthday?” “Yeah.” Then he’s like, “Hold up. January 6? Like last year? When they took over the Capitol?” I was like, “Yeah, that’s my birthday.” He’s like, “Girl! Your birthdays suck! Take care!” I love getting older, for the most part. You know what throws me off, though? Your body breaks down now. Your body isn’t what it used to, man. Ooh. I hurt my wrist. One day I woke up, and it hurt. Didn’t do anything to it. And I let it go for a couple days ’cause I thought, “Well, I didn’t hit myself or anything. So it’s just gonna go away.” A year later… now I have to get surgery on it. Yes. I have an orthopedic surgeon. I have a go-to orthopedic surgeon. I’ve seen him twice in a year and a half. I went for a shoulder that locked up. Then he fixed it, and now this is broken. And when I went to see him, he was like, “Well, Cris, you’re in your forties.” “Oh, okay. Let’s give up.” He’s just like, “That starts happening in your forties.” “Oh, okay. I’ve had a good run.” Like, that– it’s just… That’s what it is now. And then I started thinking, “I don’t give a shit.” I’ve been smiling so much lately, I’m not even happy. I’m miserable. But I just got my teeth fixed, and that shit was expensive. This is how I cry now. “I’m so sorry for your loss.” “You can do better than him.” I sort of got– My teeth were so expensive, when I die, I want an open-mouth casket. Like… I didn’t know teeth were so expensive. I got a quote from the dentist. I’m like, “Dude, I’m not buying everybody teeth, like…” Sad when you have to put your tooth on layaway. Like, “Dang, can I visit it?” But I got new teeth because at 40 I got tooth money. See? Like, we don’t talk enough about this. When you’re a kid who had nothing, and you become an adult, and you start getting money you never had as a kid, that’s a game-changer. And you don’t have to be rich, ’cause you’re rich to yourself. You know? Like, I grew up in poverty. And now, as an adult, I have money I never thought I had. You know? And now, I go crazy. I– Hell– Fuck, yeah. Guess who buys bottled water? I go to Target, I buy regular-price stuff. You peasants, go get your red-tag clearance. At 40, I got new teeth, I got health insurance. Get the hell outta here. What? I’s making it. You know that saying, “money can’t buy you happiness”? That’s bullshit. That’s poor people saying it. Let me tell you, money buy me happiness. When I got money, I went to therapy. I found out I had anxiety and depression. All my life, I just thought I was poor. I’m like, “Of course I’m sad. I’m fucking hungry.” “No!” “You’re depressed.” The doctor gave me medicine, and now I’m happy all the time. Ahh! I love telling people I’m depressed. You know why? ‘Cause that’s a rich word. You have to spend a lot of money to find out you’re depressed. Some people, like, struggle with depression. I thrive in it. I tell everybody, “Ah-ha, I’m depressed. Mm.” My family thinks I show off. “I’m depressed.” “Ay, mira. Show-off. Okay.” “Oh, I can afford therapy.” But once I started feeling better, I wanted to continue that feeling of feeling better. You know what I mean? I wanted to be happy. I’m like, “How do I continue that?” Because then I realized, now I had access to things I didn’t have growing up. And it’s hard to figure out that happiness. For me, one thing I did, I made a list. Of all the toys I wanted when I was a kid. And I bought all of the toys. Ah! And they’re not expensive toys. But they were expensive back then. And I had that moment where I played with all of them. And it felt good. You don’t think I got the OG Nintendo with the gun? Damn right I do. I’m decades late, but I duck hunt. Yes, I do. You don’t think I got a Cabbage Patch doll? Damn right I do. I’m not telling that bitch she’s adopted. She’s mine. That’s the gift that keeps on giving. ‘Cause like, the real ones come with birth certificates. I just give ’em to my family. I’m doing that now ’cause it makes me happy. You know? ‘Cause I am a first-generation Mexican American. And let me say… Oh, yeah. Yes! When you’re first-generation, life is a little different. You don’t get those Christmas gifts like everybody else does under the tree. You know what you get under the tree? More responsibility. Every year, my mom’s like, “Ay, I hope it fits.” By the time I was eight, I was helping my family pay for bills and stuff. You know? Translating everything for them. Translating medication, hoping I don’t kill them. Right? Like, “No, drink dos, don’t die.” I’d be at school, freaking out, “Did I say one or dos? I don’t know.” I’m like, drinking, slamming milks like it’s fucking beer. All the other girls are like, “Hey, you wanna play house?” I’m like, “Bitch, I live house. Get the fuck outta here.” That’s me. But now I have a chance to take care of myself. You guys, it’s amazing when you can do that. But sometimes you have to learn how to take care of yourself ’cause you were never taught how. Thank you! Yes! Dude… I wear glasses now. I don’t know, like… if you… Whoever wears glasses, do you remember the first time you put glasses on? And you’re like, “Fuuu… This has always been here?” Like, you look in the mirror, “I’m Latina?” Dude, when I got my first pair of glasses, I felt so rich. I went to Beverly Hills. I started finding rich people to talk to. Just to be like, “Yo, homie, we both ballin’, right?” Like… You know how rich people like to tell you they’re rich. They’re like, “We just got back from Paris.” I’m like, “I just got back from LensCrafters. Fuck yeah, right? Yes!” “We saw the Eiffel Tower.” “I saw that stop sign there!” “Mira. Glasses, no glasses. Glasses, no glasses.” I love it. You know? I love being able to take care of myself, but I hate having to learn how to take care of myself. It’s hard. And that’s what we need to talk about more often. Like, for me, when I got health insurance, I didn’t know what to do with it. Like, I– I’d never used it. You know what I mean? I was asking a friend of mine, like, “How do you use insurance?” And he’s like, “Go to the doctor.” I’m like, “I don’t go to doctors.” “I use Vicks.” I’m not kidding. He’s like, “What’s Vicks?” No one had ever asked me that. I felt like it was a hate crime. Like, “What are you…” I didn’t know how to respond. I’m like, “What do you mean?” He’s like, “What’s Vicks?” And I was like, “Oh.” I realized… “He’s white. He has insurance.” Right? So I was like, “I don’t know how to explain it to you.” And he’s like, “Well, what do you use Vicks for?” I’m like, “Your hopes and dreams, dude. Like, everything.” Like… “You can fix a flat tire with it. Everything. It’s… It’s like hope in a jar. Like, it’s Obama in a can. Like, what…” Then he’s like, “I know you use it for everything. But if you read the jar, what does the jar say it’s for?” I’m like, “Who the fuck reads the jar? I’ve never read the jar.” And, no kidding, he picks up the jar. He’s like, “Oh, did you know it’s expired?” I’m like, “It expires? What?” And that’s when I realized, I know nothing about Vicks. I don’t know what it is. I’ve never read to see what it says on the jar. I don’t know what Vicks is. To the point that if someone held a gun to my head, and they’re like, “Bitch, what is Vicks?” I’d be like, “Fucking shoot me, dude. I don’t know.” And then I would die. But that’s okay, ’cause I’d put Vicks on the bullet wound. And then I would come back to life. That’s what Vicks is. That’s the power! Th– That’s how I grew up. I didn’t grow up with doctors or anything. So when I got insurance, I didn’t know what to do with it, right? So I asked my friend, like, “What do I do with it?” He’s like, “Go get a checkup.” And I was like, “What’s a checkup?” You know what a checkup is? I’m gonna blow your minds. A checkup. That’s when you wake up… you’re not sick… and you say, “Fuck it, let’s go to the doctor anyway. Come on.” So I google. And the first doctor that would see me was the gynecologist. I had never been to one. I was, like, 40. I had never been to one. I didn’t know what they did. I didn’t know what they did! I was just, like, “Fuck it. A doctor’s a doctor.” I didn’t know they had doctors for down there. How do you know it’s sick? I’ve never heard it cough. And even if I did, I’d probably put Vicks on it. So I went to the checkup. Not knowing what to expect. I walk into the office. She has these silver things. I don’t know what they’re for, right? I take my keys out. I hang them. I think it’s a coat rack, right? By the way, I’m naked. I’m wearing the little paper robe, right? I don’t think anything of it. The first thing I think is, my doctor’s a woman. I’m like, “Man, this bitch got my back. She got me naked in a little paper robe so that when I step on that scale, I am light as fuck.” Because when I check my weight at home, I am naked. Like, when I get on that scale, I am naked. We all know clothes are heavy. This outfit is 50 pounds. I am naked at home. Like, if I’m chewing gum, I’m like… um… Like, I tiptoe. Like, I do “The Karate Kid”. Like, you know what I mean? She comes in with a clipboard, right? And she’s like… “All right, let’s do it.” And I was like, “All right, let’s go.” And we just look at each other. And she says, “All right.” “Got more patients. Lie down. Put your legs up. Let’s see that vagina.” “What the fuck?” So I just finished doing paperwork, and I had written… Like, they asked “occupation,” so I wrote “comedian.” So I thought she was fucking with me. Right? So she’s like, “Let’s see that vagina.” And I go with it, and I’m like, “Okay. Ahh!” “How’s it look? Ahh!” And she’s so mad at me now. And she’s like, “Lie down. Put your legs up. I need to check that vagina.” I’m like, “Shit. Not with that attitude you’re not. Get the…? No, no, no.” And I just look at her. And she says nothing. And then I realize… “Fuck, I don’t think she’s lying.” And I was like… “You wanna check my vagina?” She’s like, “Yes. I’m the vagina doctor.” I’m like, “What?” And I get so shy, so awkward, that I look at her. I’m like, “Ma’am, I can’t do that. I’m not wearing any underwear.” It’s not showroom-ready. It’s like a fixer-upper. Like… Move that bus! Like… Like, “no,” you know? Like… And she’s like, “Lie down now.” And I realize I have to do it. Like, she’s not letting me go. And I do. And I’m like… Literally, I go down so slow. Like a convertible, right? Like… And I’m going so slow ’cause there’s still part of me that thinks she’s playing chicken, right? Like, I’m gonna go down, and she’s gonna be like, “Ah, bitch, I got you.” Like… You know what I mean? I go down. I put my legs up. I don’t know what to expect. And I go like this… And she doesn’t do anything. And then she’s like, “Hey, you’re too far. Scooch on down.” And I look at her, and her face is right here. And I’m like, “Ma’am, I think you’re close enough.” She’s like, “No, no, you’re too far. Scooch on down.” And now I’m so mad, I’m like, “Come get it!” Like, I legit told her, “Come get it!” And guess what? She fucking came and got it. Dude, she started treating me like she was moving out of her apartment and had to clean the fridge, you know what I mean? Like… “This is expired, this is expired, this is…” Like, seriously. And it was so quiet. Yo. When I’m dating someone, at least they have a playlist, right? Like, “End of the Road,” something. “Water Runs Dry.” This woman was all quiet. Like… And then she finishes. And she leaves. Like they all do. I know. I know. You get it, girl. And after a little while, she comes in and she’s smiling. She’s like, “Hey, Cristela, it was really nice to meet you.” And I was like, “Uh, bitch, I’m sorry, no. It’s a little late for that. I’m Mexican. In my culture, we’re fucking engaged. No.” Like, “Oh, I got myself a doctor.” Like you know what I mean? And then I realize that she’s smiling ’cause she has to break some news to me. Mm-hm. So she comes in smiling. She’s like, “Hey, Cristela. It’s really nice to meet you.” “So here’s the thing, um… I think you’re diabetic.” And the first thing I thought was, “How high did she go up?” And I was like, “You’re the vagina doctor.” She’s like, “Yes, I’m the vagina doctor. And you’re diabetic.” I was like, “Wow.” And I thought about it. And I thought about it. And I was like… “How diabetic do you have to be… for the vagina doctor to be the one that finds it?” I didn’t even know diabetes was an STD. What? Like, what do I do now? Do I have to call up everybody I’ve been with and let them know? Like, “Hey, dude, I just got tested. I tested positive for diabetes. I don’t know if it’s contagious but I just wanted to let you know.” Like, “Tell everybody you’ve been with. Good luck.” And then I started thinking, “What if it’s contagious?” “Who the fuck gave me diabetes?” Now I wanna call up everybody back and be like, “Yo, did you put sugar on your dick?” “Was that a condom or a Fruit Roll-Up? What happened?” And then she tells me she found out I was diabetic from the urine sample. Fucking start with that. I’m all confused. I don’t know medicine. I’m like, “What’s next? The eye doctor says I have a yeast infection? How the fuck does this work?” I was so confused. I’m like, “How did she know?” Like, did she look down there and Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory was there? She looked down there and an Oompa Loompa came out with a flute. And sang a song, like, Oompa loompa doo-pa-dee-doo This bitch got diabetes type two Like, what happened? Now I can’t do anything anymore. I– I don’t– I don’t do anything. All day long, I just sit at home and watch murder shows. That’s it now. I don’t know why I love murder shows. I’m so obsessed with them. Yo. If I see a marathon of Forensic Files, it’s like porn to me. I sit down in front of the couch. I’m like, “That’s right. Killing for the insurance.” Like, I get into it. There’s a channel called the ID channel. Shows murder 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Murder, murder, murder! I watch it so much, I start cheering for these people. I saw a woman kill her husband last week. I’m like, “That’s right, Lydia.” “We don’t need no man.” I watch so many crime shows, I think I can solve things in real life. Like if I’m in traffic and there’s a sign that says, like, “Missing Person,” I’m like, “Oh, shit, I’m on the case.” I start looking. I’m afraid that one day I’ll take it too far, right? Like, I’ll get pulled over by a cop and he’s gonna be like, “Did you see that stop sign?” And I’m like, “No, I didn’t see that stop sign. Why? ‘Cause I’m looking for Amanda. What the fuck are you doing?” “That stop sign’s not moving. Where’s Amanda?” The other day, I woke up and I got mad. ‘Cause I was thinking, you ever notice people my age and older, we never got thanked for learning the internet. We gave it to the future. “You’re welcome, future.” We did that. ‘Cause now I’m at the point where, like, I see that there’s kids that are bored that have never had to deal with no technology. We had to figure it out. And now, people will judge you. Like, I don’t getTikTok. I was like, “I don’t get TikTok. Someone explain it to me.” They’re like, “You’re just too old.” “Fuck you.”Guess what? I gave you TikTok. I had to go through bullshit like MySpace so that you could have TikTok. You don’t know what it’s like to have your friends not talk to you ’cause you wouldn’t put them in the “top eight” spots.What is TikTok? I mean, seriously. The lockdown started, TikTok blew up, and it was just families dancing. People were dying all over the world, but they’re like, “Look at our rhythm.” ¿Abuela? Like, what? To me, TikTok is just hot people pointing at things for, like, a minute. “I know I live with my parents, but here are some business tips.” We learned the internet. Think about it. We were technological pioneers. One day, we woke up, boom. AOL CDs with 1500 hours on them. We didn’t know what to do. We had to figure it out. There was no YouTube. We had to connect to the internet with a landline. A landline. Some of you don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about. A landline. Let me explain a landline. Back in the day, a family would share one phone. But it was glued to the wall. And if you were lucky, it came with a long-ass cable. You could talk in the kitchen, in the living room… And you always knew when you had to go back. ‘Cause it was like, “Oh…” If you wanted to get on the internet, you had to unplug your phone, plug it into your computer, and call the internet. And hope it wasn’t busy. And it always sounded like the internet would die for you. Like, “Oh, my God, I don’t know. Here I go.” “You’ve got mail.” “From who?” Using the phone was a big deal. We were all so excited to use the phone. When I was growing up, getting a call at your house, that was a big deal. That was like a rite of passage. When people would start calling you. “Is Cristela there?” “Oh my God, it’s me! Hi!” It was such a big deal because not everybody could do it. Now we’re so connected, I get a phone call, I’m like, “Who the fuck is calling me? Text me like a human being, damn it.” I was expecting so much more from the internet. I thought we were gonna be smart. I thought we were gonna be geniuses. I’m a nerd. I thought, “That’s how you get to Star Trek. We’re all gonna be so smart.” Guess what? We’re not. We’re dumb. Think about it. The year is 2022. It’s seven years afterBack to the Future Part II. Where are the flying cars? We don’t have hoverboards. The only thing that came true was that Biff was president. It was hard to keep in touch with people. But we had to make the effort. My first cell phone had a feature called “weekend and nighttime minutes.” I don’t wanna brag. Back in the day, every cell phone plan would come with a hundred anytime minutes. And after you were done with those 100 minutes, they would charge you a thousand dollars a minute. And if you wanted to talk to anybody you gave a shit about, you had to wait ’til Saturday or Sunday or after00 p.m. And the rest of the week, you’re like, “Man, I hope that bitch isn’t dead.” But we’re so connected, we’re disconnected. Social media? We don’t treat each other like people anymore. People wanna pick a fight with you. Sometimes they’ll call out good shit. They’ll call right shit. But you got people that are looking for anything. They just wanna be mad. Like, I can’t write anything on Twitter that doesn’t upset someone. I can write something simple like, “I hate traffic.” And someone’ll be like, “Hey, you bitch!” “My grandfather is half-Irish, half-traffic!” Like, “What?” Like, “What? What?” But you know what? Now we need to come together to actually see what we can do. Shit is messed up. But it doesn’t have to be. I never thought that racism was gonna come back the way it did. It never went away. But the power, the pride, that I never thought they were gonna have again. But fuck they do. You know? I didn’t expect the KKK to come back. I mean, and there they are, fucking wearing their white sheets. You know how racist you have to be to spend that much money on detergent? Like, that’s heavy-duty laundry, man. So I started thinking about all that shit. And I started thinking, “I wanna fight that. How do I fight that?” And I started thinking, “Well, that’s a hate group.” Guess what? I hate hate. I was like… “I hate hate.” And I started thinking about it, and I’m like, “You know what? That’s what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna start a group. And it’s a hate hate club.” We hate hate. And we use brown sheets. So that they can be dirty and we’re okay with it. Now, I’m pitching it to you. Okay? ‘Cause I– I’m still– I’m still working it out. Okay? So… It’s a hate hate group. And it’s for everybody, but it’s only for Latinos. Okay. So… Hate hate! Everybody’s welcome. Only for Latinos. I call it the Qué-Qué-Qué. ‘Cause every day, I wake up, I watch the news, I’m like, “¿Qué?” “¿Qué? ¿Qué?” In Caucasian, that’s “What?” “What? What?” It’s time to call out the bullshit. There’s been a lot of bad stuff that’s been around for years that we have to correct. Like the whole thinking, “Mexicans are taking away our jobs.” No, they’re not. It just feels like that ’cause it’s Mario Lopez doing that. It’s Mario Lopez taking away your job. Does that guy say yes to everything? That’s the whole thinking. When we talk about “Mexicans are taking away our jobs.” Right? They make it seem like we’re coming in and just sneaking into the White House, and it’s like, “Ah, fuck it. I’m Chief of Staff.” The truth is, you don’t want those jobs. Do you know how I know? ‘Cause I’ve never seen a white woman out in the fields picking vegetables with Latinos. You’ve never seen that. Out in the field, this white woman, like, “Oh, my God, Maria, it is hot today, right?” “Caliente.” “I’ve had two coconut waters today. It’s fantastic. Hold on. ChapStick. Let’s get to work. I brought my Fitbit for the steps. Hey, after this, do you wanna go get some Italian?” Thank you guys! My name is Cristela Alonzo! You’ve been fantastic! Thank you so much! Cristela, I’m still waiting here. I hope you didn’t forget about me. You know, we have a movement to run. Yes. Yeah, we have to save democracy, Cristela. Really. I’m here waiting. What happened? Please call me. Oy vey! And up! Use your knees, Page. Come on, push it.

    "transcript":"Dave Chappelle: The Unstoppable (2025)Release date:December 20, 2025 (Netflix) Dave Chappelle: The Unstoppableis built around controversy rather than jokes in the traditional sense, andChappelleleans into that expectation with little interest in softening the impact. Much of the set circles around speech boundaries, cultural taboos, and the pleasure he clearly takes in crossing lines that are supposed to be closed. His defense of performing in Saudi Arabia, paired with open contempt for American moral outrage, is one of the show’s pressure points: Chappelle frames U.S. criticism as selective, hypocritical, and opportunistic, especially when compared with domestic censorship, cancellation campaigns, and political intimidation at home. Gender and transgender material reappears aggressively, treated less as satire than as a stress test for audience tolerance, culminating in grotesque exaggerations meant to provoke recoil rather than laughter. The same strategy applies to race and power, especially when Chappelle describes buying up large sections of his Ohio town and enjoying the reversal of gentrification rhetoric, exposing how quickly liberal goodwill collapses when Black wealth becomes dominant rather than symbolic. The longest and most combustible section rewrites American history through Jack Johnson, linking racial panic, sexual transgression, and legal repression into a single narrative of control. Chappelle treats this as unfinished business, implicitly tying it to modern celebrity prosecutions, surveillance, and moral theater. The show closes with an intentionally inflammatory “code word,” designed to short-circuit interpretation and remind the audience that provocation, rather than reconciliation, remains his primary objective.

OCTOBER 27, 2019THE KENNEDY CENTERMARK TWAIN PRIZE FOR AMERICAN HUMOR I was a soft kid. I was sensitive, I’d cry easy, and I would be scared to fistfight. And my mother used to tell me this thing, I don’t know if you remember, but you said this to me more than once. You said, “Son, sometimes you have to be a lion so you can be the lamb you really are.” I talk this shit like a lion. Come king, try and bask Claw slash, lion sword Bring war to your front door Till we no see you no more Kill or be killed is a skill What we learn and master Annihilate and decimate Like a natural disaster No doubt we’ve calmed the beast I warned you about Bloody rain and thunder Roar if we catching a drought Mapogo lions on the concrete plain Ni*gas running from our shadows ‘Cause we all spit flames Lion heart we share upon Why Babylon can’t breathe They village with every step we take Mapogo looks so deceptive But my cause is perfected Then turn round and dissect it From the fear and disrespect The smoke hit different When your screen is cigarettes Big Ben, Queen Elizabeth I stepped up for the ones you ate For then multiplied in snake form We in hell boy, breathe ’em In order for you to live You need young to murk The kidneys, organs, they all choose You can keep the ruby chains I don’t like y’all jewels Wrapped around my neck Squeezed tight, I bleed life Scream light in this bitch I’ve seen lightning get thick Brain storm, it got heavy My vision never cloudy The form stay right, ni*ga howdy… Yo, thank you. Thank you very much. Please, everyone, have a seat. Be comfortable. We got a lot to talk about. Now, I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you how this show came to be. You guys know I live in Ohio. In January, when this ni*ga, Trump and Elon… made this DOGE thing, and cut all those government jobs, the housing market in my hometown plunged 20% in the first quarter. And I don’t mean to talk like a white… but, boy, they did that, didn’t they? And then when this ni*ga deployed the National Guard in my hometown and took the police department from the mayor, oh, D.C. ni*gas, we don’t like that. But then my governor in Ohio sent our National Guard to police my hometown. And I called these ni*gas and said, “I’m pulling up.” Because these ni*gas is trying to take the chocolate out of Chocolate City. I said, “I gotta go home while it’s still the city I remember.” And then I went on Instagram and saw all the protests in D.C. There was a bunch of white people like, “Not on our streets!” I said, “Oh, no, it’s too late.” These whites are entrenched. “Not on our goddamn streets, you don’t.” This ni*ga Trump was talking like he goes out to dinner. It’s not like that. Yeah, and I gotta tell you the truth. This is not the only city this is happening in. It’s happening in California, it’s happening in Oregon, it’s happening in Illinois, and it’s happening in Memphis. And… and ni*gas in Memphis, they might need it. You got to be reasonable. I don’t know if you’ve been in Memphis recently, but them ni*gas already stole two tanks from the National Guard, so you already know. You already know, you know. And I came here mad, ready to fight, but when I drove through the city, it looked clean, guys. I got to tell you. I got to tell you, it looked clean. A lot better than the last time I was here. Today I only saw one guy take a shit on the street. But you know what? He had a bag. That ni*ga picked it up. I was waiting for somebody to do something about the homeless. You know what’s fucked up about D.C.? We the nation’s capital and nobody even gives a fuck about the homeless. I’m gonna tell you the truth. I feel like I’m the only one that does. Now, y’all don’t know this, but quietly for the last two years, I have been secretly working with Washington’s homeless, and I have spent two million dollars already on my homeless project. No, no, no, don’t clap for me. I didn’t give ’em food or anything like that. I just taught these ni*gas the “Thriller” dance. And you got a big treat coming up on Halloween, you’ll see. And I’m sorry I didn’t come home sooner, but I’ve been very busy in Ohio. And a lot of people say, “What are you doing out there?” And I don’t know if you know this, but this is true. I’ll tell you what I’ve been doing. The town that I’ve been living in for the last 25 years, I bought most of it. I like it there. Ohio loves Trump, but this town I live in is like a little itty-bitty Bernie Sanders Island in the Trump Sea. All the whites are poor out there, but these are like the dirty hippie whites, and I like them. I like these whites. And they like me too. But you know what I learned about liberal white people? Liberal white people let Black people do whatever fuck they want until you buy most of their town. Oh, they frowned on that. Them whites got real suspicious, but you know what? I don’t blame them. Because… No, for real, because look, if I was white and the people in this town were Black, you know what they’d say? They would say I was gentrifying the town. But there’s no word for what I’m doing to these people. I own everything, ni*ga, everything. I used to be mad at white people when I was young because I thought they were unfair. But now that I have all this property, I understand them. It’s fun. Feels good to walk up to white people like, “Are you supposed to be here?” “Calling the police.” It’s fun. I own so much property in this town, and this is true, these white people think I’m responsible for their wellbeing. That’s ridiculous. Ni*ga, I’m not no public servant. I’m a capitalist. I be walking down the street minding my own business, and they come up to me with their concerns. “Dave!” “Congratulations on buying the whole goddamn town. But you need to start thinking about some affordable housing around here.” And I’ll be like, “Well, actually, champ, I can afford my house.” “That sounds like some shit you need to worry about. Because if I think about it, I can afford your house too. So if you want to sell, come holler at your boy. I’m collecting the whole town. I’m collecting the whole goddamn town.” You know, I don’t know where these poor whites got the money. But not long ago, these motherfuckers built a brand-new fire station out of the blue. Where the fuck they get this money from? I was like, “What the fuck is this?” And then you know what they did? They… This is some real racist shit. They tried to sell the old fire station at an auction when they knew I was gonna be out of town. It’s fucked up. But it’s far too late for that. I got that whole town rigged with snitches. Them ni*gas couldn’t wait to tell me. They was running up. “My lord, my lord, I have news, my lord!” I was like, “What’s going on? What is this you say? A firehouse?” Ni*ga, I bought the firehouse. I turned that motherfucker into a comedy and music club. We be rocking in there. Clipse been there. We all be out there rocking. Every famous person I’ve ever met, I asked them to play that club. I seen Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones at a party. I sat down and said, “Yo, Mick.” I said, “Mick, you gotta come to Ohio and play in my club.” And he was into it. He was like, “All right.” He said, “All right, I like playing clubs.” He said, “But tell me about the town.” I said, “Well, what do you want to know?” And that ni*ga looked at me like… like, you know, the Mick Jagger look. He said… “Are there girls there?” I… I lied right in his face. I was like, “Yeah.” He knew something was wrong. He’s like… “No, no, no. Come on, Dave. You know, like the kind of girls that I like.” I said, “Mick, I… I don’t know… I don’t… I don’t know what kind of girls you like.” Then he said… “You know. You’ve heard my music. Are there white bitches with dirty feet?” I said, “Mick, you are going to love this place. Mick, these bitches will put a ring around a public pool.” Dirty hippie pussy, that’s what I’m dealing with. I’m not a drug guy at all, right? But… But I am in show business, you know what I mean? So, I’ve been to every kind of party. Now… Now, I’m gonna be honest with you, I smoke weed, but I don’t consider weed a drug. But you know how show business is. I’ve been to cocaine parties, I’ve been to weed parties, I’ve been to all the parties, and I’m just telling you the truth of what I’ve seen. Coke bitches are way prettier than weed bitches are. I be looking at weed bitches like, “Damn, bitch, did you sleep in those clothes? The fuck’s going on with you?” No energy in the face. They don’t wear their bra all the time so their titties be sagging. “Get your dick out of my face, man.” That’s how a weed girl sounds. “I’m not gonna suck your cock, man. My mouth is dry as a bone.” You ever get some weed head? Feels gross, doesn’t it? Feels like a cat sucking your dick. Like, what kind of… How do you not have any moisture in your mouth? Bitch, go wet your whistle and try again, would you? Go drink some water. Yuck. Yuck. Recently in the news… I’ve been getting a lot of grief, again… because I did a comedy festival inSaudi Arabia. And you hear those cheers, that’s Black people. America’s whites, they’re furious. Boy, I gotta tell you something, I’ve never not felt guilty about something. Like, I’ve never felt… I don’t feel… I don’t feel… I don’t feel guilty at all. You know, and… andBill Maher, the famous comedian, I’ve known Bill since I was, like, 18, 19 years old, and I’ve never said this publicly, but fuck that guy. I’m so fucking tired of his little smug, cracker-ass commentary. These motherfuckers act like because I did a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia, I somehow betrayed my principles. Well… No, no, I know I didn’t, I know. No, no, no. No, let me… Come on, everybody, let me do this. And I’m sure… No. All right, now everybody calm down. No, I’m sure I’m right. First of all, what… what did they say? They said… They said, “Well…” They said, “Well…” They said, “Well, Saudi Arabia killed a journalist.” And rest in peace, Jamal Khashoggi. I’m sorry that he got murdered in such a heinous fashion. But… And no “buts,” like, you know, period. And also… I mean, look, bro, Israel’s killed 240 journalists… in the last three months. So, I didn’t know y’all was still counting. These ni*gas clowned me because I was on stage in Saudi Arabia. I didn’t tell them to put this in the paper. I just said it on stage. I said, “It’s easier to talk in Saudi Arabia for me than it… than it is in America.” And… And ni*gas felt some kind of way. Oh, I stand ten toes on that. Don’t forget what I just went through. Two years ago, I almost got canceled right here in the United States fortransgender jokes. But I gotta tell you something. Transgender jokes went over very well in Saudi Arabia. Them ni*gas couldn’t get enough of that shit. I was in the pocket, ni*ga. I was like, “Where have you been?” Every article said that comedians whored themselves out to a dictator. But… But all the articles have my picture on it. And you know what? I can’t even get mad. ‘Cause, you know, to be fair, I did make more money than all of those comedians. I don’t even work at Netflix no more, ni*ga. You know what my new job is? I sit by the phone and wait for them Arabs to call me. “Can I help you guys? What do you need?” I loveworking in the Middle East. That’s my second show I did over there. I did a show three months before that. That was in Abu Dhabi. Them ni*gas had a… a… a comedy festival too. And let me tell you something. Now, y’all never been in the Middle East. Here’s some wild shit about them you might not know. You know how everybody got, like, a dog around here? Out there, they don’t fuck with dogs. You know what they do? They got… They got birds, falcons, ni*ga. These ni*gas have as pets, they have falcons. I couldn’t believe it. I went to the mall, I saw these ni*gas with falcons. I’m like, “This shit is dope.” And, you know, here in D.C., we might see, like, a pimp here or there. And that’s… But I’ve never seen a ni*ga pimp a bird. That ni*ga just had the bird like, “Bring me a rabbit.” And that motherfucking bird would just bring this ni*ga a rabbit. And he’d just give the bird a piece and eat the rest himself. So, I saw a guy at the mall with one of these falcons. We were just talking about bullshit. And I don’t know what… I don’t know why I even thought to do this. Something just came over me. I said… I said, “Yo…” I said, “Yo, ni*ga, let me borrow that falcon.” He did it. He gave me the mitten, and he gave me the falcon. Now, I’ve done a lot of fly shit in my life, but the most rock star shit I’ve ever done, you’d never know what this feels like. I walked into an arena this size, 20,000 people screaming. I had a live falcon on my arm. Ni*gas went crazy. Crowd was going nuts. This is their national bird. Now, I don’t know shit about the bird. Turns out, this species of falcon that was on my arm is the single fastest creature on earth. I didn’t know that. Apparently when it hunts, it flies straight up and then it dives down at 240 miles an hour, they’ve clocked it at. It strikes its prey dead and then flies off and comes back, and gets whatever it killed. I didn’t know that. And when I was walking through the arena, the crowd was screaming, but the falcon didn’t panic, ’cause it had some kind of mask on, and that ni*ga was just looking like… But it didn’t trip. Now, I didn’t know, this mask is part of the falcon’s training. If you take the mask off the falcon, it will think that it’s time to hunt. Boy, I wish he’d told me that. ‘Cause I was on the stage killing it, and the falcon was just looking all stupid like this. And I’m like, “Oh, man, this ni*ga can’t even see the show.” So, I took the mask off. Man, this falcon lost his goddamn mind. Mayhem ensued. That motherfucker fluttered like this and flew off my arm. And at first, everybody was clapping, “Yeah!” And that ni*ga dove down, 240 miles an hour. Killed a bitch in the third row. And it was a transgender bitch. When it hit her, her dick popped out. Everybody screamed. I was like, “Oh, shit.” I didn’t know what to do. Next thing I know, the police, the Arab police came and these ni*gas just ushered me off stage. I didn’t realize that I was under arrest. I said, “What’s the meaning of this?” Clearly, these guys know it was an accident. And the next thing I know, they charged me with murder. I said, “Murder?” The fuck? It was an accident. And then they had me in a court, and these ni*gas started reading transcripts of all my transgender jokes. Trying to act like I killed this bitch on purpose. I said, “I didn’t even know this bitch was trans until her dick popped out. This is a goddamn outrage. I’m an American!” I still didn’t think I was gonna get in trouble, but at the end of the case, this is the only word in the whole trial I understood. That ni*ga said, “Guilty.” I said, “What?” And my whole life flashed before my eyes. I said, “I wish I never came out here.” You’re probably wondering how I’m here tonight. Well, I didn’t know this at the time, but I found out, lucky for me, killing a transgender in the Middle East, misdemeanor. Phew! Yeah, it’s way easier to talk… in Saudi Arabia… Jimmy Kimmelgot canceled. Let me tell you something too. Not only did they cancel Jimmy Kimmel, this guy Carr that runs the FCC had the nerve to say that Kimmel, if he wanted to get back on television… I don’t know if Carr said this, but somebody said this. They said this ni*ga has to pay Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA Foundation money to get back on. Now, think about that. No, think about it.Elon Muskbought the election for Trump because the Supreme Court said that money was free speech. So, you can spend your money however you want to speak, but if they make this ni*ga pay some money for some shit he doesn’t believe in, well then they’re compelling him to say something that he does not mean. And six million… Oh, excuse me. Listen, I made a lot of money. But I’ll take money from Saudi Arabia any day, just so I can say no over here. It feels good to be free. And I know that the people in Saudi Arabia can’t say all the things that I was allowed to say. But a deal’s a deal, and the king said that I could say these things. So, I looked at it like I was on a diplomatic mission. I gotta bring pussy jokes to the Middle East. ‘Cause they got all that pussy over there and they can’t even talk about it. I said, “I’ll do it.” Shit ain’t what it used to be, is it? This ni*ga Puff got 50 months. I don’t like talking about this, but I’m gonna do it. Here’s my thing about Puffy, and I gotta state my bias. Years ago, I got attacked on stage… in… in California at the Hollywood Bowl. Now, this was a long time ago. At this time,Charlie Kirkwas alive and well. This is another reason it’s hard to talk in America, ’cause, you know, if you talk for a living and see Charlie Kirk get murdered that way, I’m gonna be honest, ni*ga, I was shook. I mean, Charlie Kirk is the wholesome white guy, and they killed this motherfucker. I said, “These whites…” “You’ve never seen them like this.” “They’re playing for keeps.” And then remember, the next day in the news, when all the information was still shoddy, they came out and they were like, “Apparently there were transgender messages inscribed on the bullets.” I was at home like, “Oh, no! I’m dead as fried chicken!” And then weeks later they said what was written on the bullets. One of the bullets had“Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella, Bella, Bella Ciao”written on it. Another bullet had written on it, “If you’re reading this, you’re gay.” I was at home like, “Ni*ga, I’m gonna need to see these bullets.” How the fuck is this ni*ga writing whole paragraphs on bullets? How big are these bullets? What is this ni*ga, a watchmaker? He can inscribe all this shit on a bullet? I’m not making light of Charlie Kirk dying, but I’m not sure what it means, and I’m not sure I believe what they say it means. I’ll tell you what I don’t believe, and the whites were quick to say this. They said, “Charlie Kirk is this generation’s Martin Luther King.” No, he’s not. Yeah, that’s a… that’s a reach. You know, they both got murdered in a terrible fashion. They both got shot in the neck, but that’s about where those similarities end. ‘Cause Charlie Kirk is a motherfucking… internet personality. No, by design. Fundamentally, he can’t function like Dr. King. Internet ni*gas are negative because they have to be. ‘Cause nobody will engage them unless they say shit that makes them upset. That’s Charlie Kirk. Could you imagine Dr. King was behaving like Charlie Kirk? “Smash that like button and subscribe.” “Follow me for more content like this.” “I believe all Black people should be free. Change my mind.” The Congress took a vote… that October 14th would be Charlie Kirk Remembrance Day, and everybody voted for it. No, no, no, I’m not going to boo it. You can reme… Hey, hey, hey, no, no. Remember that ni*ga if you want to. And remember him however you want to. But I do know that most of those congresspeople voted for that ’cause they’re afraid of political violence. I’m telling you, it’s easier to talk in Saudi Arabia. I was on stage not long ago in the States and ni*gas got mad ’cause I said, “Well, you know, maybe Puff will get off.” And I said, “I hope so.” And the crowd was like, “Boo.” Okay, look, it’s not that I think Puff is right, but when I got attacked in L.A. at the Hollywood Bowl, people forget Puff was the guy that tackled my attacker. He saved my life. That’s a hard ni*ga to be mad at after that. I had security that night, but you know what I mean? Them ni*gas… They just wasn’t ready. Them ni*gas had some slippery shoes on or something. They ran out. All them ni*gas slipped and fell. And Puffy got my attacker and tackled him. And then years later, when I heard about that baby oil, I was like, “What did those ni*gas slip on?” A thousand bottles of baby oil, that’s a lot. Remember, he wasn’t on trial for having a thousand bottles of baby oil because it’s not a crime to have a thousand bottles of baby oil. It’s gross. It’s not illegal. And I’m going to tell you something else I haven’t said… but this is true. In L.A. one night… I shouldn’t even tell… Fuck it. I’ve been to Puffy’s house. No, I didn’t see… Look, no, I didn’t see none of the stuff they said in that trial. I walked through that ni*ga’s living room, house was clean, traction on the floor, nothing slippery, walked right through. Perfectly normal evening. The only thing… the only thing, in hindsight, but at the time it didn’t mean nothing to me… I didn’t think about it until after I found all that stuff out. But in hindsight, it was fucked up, but we was on his back patio, and we was drinking and laughing, talking, and then Puff starts swirling his drink like this, and he goes… He goes, “So, Dave.” He goes, “What are you into?” You know me, I didn’t… I was like, “I don’t know, ni*ga, books, video games, um…” I didn’t know that was my big chance to fuckCassie… God bless her. I’m not making light of her. What she went through was terrible. But remember… But remember, ’cause they kept showing this video of him beating her up in a hotel hallway. It was a terrible video. Uh, but he wasn’t on trial for that.! If you remember, he paid her for that before the federal charges ever came up. He paid her 35 million dollars, is what I heard. Which doesn’t make it right, but I mean, come on, ni*ga. I do know ni*gas that have fought Floyd Mayweather for less money than that. And them ni*gas had to fight for 36 minutes. But Cassie is a gangster. She did something that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. She had to testify about her sex life. Boy, that’s tough. God save us all from that. Anything you say about sex publicly is gonna sound bad. Even if you’re talking about fucking your wife face-to-face. The judge is like, “Tell me about when you… Did you fuck your wife face-to-face?” “Yes, Your Honor, I did.” “Well, could you describe the…” “Well, yes, I looked at her in her cold, bored eyes, and then I… Then I pulled those big panties aside, and it’s like a bush that just screams, ‘I don’t give a fuck, ‘ and I just… You know what I mean? Just powered through it, you know what I mean?” Cassie had to do way harder than that. Them questions… They was like, they was asking her all kinds… “Did Sean Combs pee in your mouth?” I was like, “Oh my God.” “Yes, Your Honor, he did. He peed…” Tonight, I had done something, I had, like, prepared something that I wanted to try. It was hard though, but I really wanted… It’s the longest closer in the history of my career. I’m gonna do it, but, boy, this is gonna take a lot of focus, so please don’t yell out and distract me, just enjoy it. No, it’s hard, you know, like… Look, man, closing the show… closing the show is everything, and closing the show in D.C. is very important. So tonight, I’m gonna do two different closers. I’ll do my closer for D.C., and then after that… This bitch scream like a car alarm, did you hear that? Did everybody else hear that? Jesus Christ! All right, and then after that, if I can get to it, I’ll do my closer from Saudi Arabia. All right, this is the tough one. Hey, do me a favor, production, sex it up, give me, like, comedy club lights. All right, let me concentrate. This is… When you see it, you’ll understand this is harder than it… It’s harder to do this than you think. Hold on. Go ahead, keep screaming. I love you too, homie. Listen, I say this… hoping that this brings somebody in this audience peace. I really do mean what I’m about to say. I know how it is right now. I understand how a lot of people feel. Turn your walkie down, champ. I know how a lot of you guys are feeling right now. You can’t hear me? Can you hear me? Got thatBill Cosby. It’s not gonna give me much time. I know how people are feeling right now, and I hope that this brings you peace. I feel that way too. Without question, 1,000% without question, all of us, individually and collectively, are living through some sort of a conspiracy, I’m sure. That feeling you have that something is wrong, or you might feel like, “Hey, am I right about this? Am I crazy?” No, ni*ga. No, you’re not crazy. This thing you’re feeling, I’m telling you, I feel it too. But here’s what I suggest. If you don’t know what the conspiracy is, then just say that. “I don’t know” is an acceptable answer. In fact, if you don’t know, it is the best answer. But all this fucking guessing out loud about what the conspiracy is, I’m begging you, please, shut the fuck up. You’re gonna make everybody sick that way. You can say “I feel,” you can say “I think” or “I suspect,” or, “It looks to me like,” but please, please stop saying you know. Because in times like this, the last person I trust is the ni*ga that’s sure. This ismadness. But here’s what I think. Somehow this country went wrong… in 1910. I… I narrowed it down to a specific dude. It has… It has something to do… And think about what I say later, not now. It has something to do withJack Johnson. Jack Johnson… was the first Black heavyweight champion of the world. And the heavyweight championship to this day is the most prestigious title in sports. But in 1908… only white fighters had that distinction. Not because Black fighters weren’t good enough, but because no white fighter would give any Black person the opportunity to lay their hands on them. And a guy namedTommy Burnsbecame heavyweight champion. And Tommy Burns was an anomaly. He was Canadian. And he said, “I am the heavyweight champion of the world.” He’s Canadian. You know how, you know, faggy they are. He was like… He said, “I am not the champion of Canada, I am not the champion of white men. I am the heavyweight champion of the world, and I will defend my championship against all comers.” And boy… Jack Johnson got the opportunity to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world not from an American, like he was, but from a Canadian. Now, you think that Americans would root for Jack Johnson because he was an American. No, this ni*ga was blacker than Wesley Snipes. Tommy Burns was at that time the shortest person to ever be heavyweight champion of the world. And Jack Johnson stepped in the ring and towered above him. And… And… And… And, you know, he beat his… He beat the fuck out of Tommy Burns. In Sydney, Australia. And all the white fighters in America were like, “You see what we mean? Fighting those goddamn dirty fighting monkeys.” Before Tommy Burns, the heavyweight champion had retired. It was a man namedJim Jeffries. And everyone said, “Jack Johnson’s not the real champion.” They said, “Jim Jeffries is the real champion, and it’s a good thing he’s not fighting, or he’d beat your Black ass, Jack Johnson.” So, Jack Johnson… Jack Johnson called out Jim Jeffries. It happened first in London. Jim Jeffries was in a parade in London, and Jack Johnson’s Black ass stepped out of the crowd. This ni*ga was dressed to the nines. He was very articulate. He said, “I say, old boy, I sure would like to give you a wallop.” Jim Jeffries was just looking at him. “What the fuck?” And then Jim Jeffries was in a parade in Sydney, Australia, and Jack Johnson stepped out of the crowd again. “I say, old boy, I sure do want to give you the old one, two.” Jim Jeffries was looking like, “How does this ni*ga have a passport?” Again, this was 1910. The hallmark of Jack Johnson’s character was audacity. There’s a story about him that’s a legend that says that one night he was caught speeding down a country road south of the Mason-Dixon line, and the police pulled Jack Johnson’s Black ass over. You know, this was 1910. He must have been flying, 13, 14 miles an hour… The police stopped him. The police said, “It cost 200 dollars for a nigger to speed on our roads down here.” Back then, 200 dollars was like getting a 50,000-dollar ticket. This ni*ga Jack Johnson didn’t hesitate. He gave him 400 dollars and said, “I’m coming back this way.” After months of persistence… Jim Jeffries relented. And Jack Johnson defended his title against Jim Jeffries on the Fourth of July. This is where the phrase “The Great White Hope” came from. They were dying to find any white man that could put this ni*ga in his place. I’ll tell you what, on the Fourth of July, Jim Jeffries was not the guy. Jack Johnson fucked his ass up. And Jack Johnson did what they call in boxing, “Carried the fight,” which means he could have knocked him out in the early rounds, but he didn’t wanna die. He wanted to make it look good. But when he got sick of it, ’cause back then it wasn’t no, like, 15-round fights, ni*gas just fought till they couldn’t fight anymore. And when Jack Johnson got bored… put him away with a vicious right hook, and you see Jim Jefferies in the footage start to fall, but then the film cuts off. ‘Cause they didn’t want any imagery… of this ni*ga knocking out their hope. And on July 5th, all over the United States, there were riots, white riots, where they killed many Black people to make sure that the rest of these ni*gas knew their place. Because Jack Johnson was the first Black person to physically confront the color line and win. And here’s the punchline. He didn’t just leave the arena with his life. Jack Johnson had a very particular proclivity. He left the arena with his life and a white bitch. Let’s talk about it. You see, Jack Johnson loved fucking white women. Almostexclusively, he would fuck white women. And, man, the audacity of this ni*ga beating white men up and fucking their bitches. The Black boxing world was elated. And every great Black fighter celebrated Jack Johnson. And they came to Jack Johnson, they said, “Jack, congratulations. Can I get a title fight?” And Jack Johnson, just like his white predecessors, said, “Well, I don’t fight Black fighters. I’m in the business of beating up white guys and fucking their bitches.” And one after another… they lined up the Great White Hopes, and Jack Johnson would vanquish them all. In fact… In fact, it took an act of Congress… to stop him. Congressman named Mann from Illinois came up with an act called the “Mann Act.” The Mann Act is the law that says it is illegal to take a woman across state lines for the purposes of debauchery. In my line of work, got to know shit like that. Jack Johnson got tried, prosecuted, convicted of the Mann Act, fled the country, was on the run for years, and it ruined his life. And then finally in 1946, he died in the United States in a car crash. But before he died, and this is one of my favorite quotes that any American ever said, he said, “I riskedeverything… for my pleasure.” You know, having freedom is one thing. Not having freedom is another thing. But using freedom that you don’t have takes an enormous amount of courage, no matter how selfish you are with it. And Jack Johnson… is an American riddle… that we’ve gotta solve. Not too long ago, but some years ago, I was here in Washington. I was at… I was at the MGM… at the… at the National Harbor, and I wasn’t performing. I was at… I was at a Stevie Wonder show. And Stevie Wonder didn’t know I was there. I was on the side stage. I got there late, he was already doing the show. And this was a very special night. It… It was the night… It was the night before… Aretha Franklin’s funeral. And… And Aretha Franklin was a very special person to me. The first time I ever played Radio City, she gave me a job as her opening act. Mean boss, but great, great, great, great, great, great artist. And Steve was on stage, killing it. And then in the middle of his set… he started to sing a medley of all the songs that he had ever written for Aretha Franklin. And, man, I gotta tell you, it was a lot. Huge hits that I didn’t even know he wrote. And the crowd was grooving and celebrating her life. And just suddenly, in the middle of it… Stevie broke down crying. Put his head down on the piano, and I could hear him sob. And I was drunk. And it hurts a man to hear another man cry. And I didn’t even think about it. I was like, “I must go to him.” And I just walked down on stage. And, you know, it’s home. When the crowd saw me, they started cheering. But Stevie didn’t know it was me. That ni*ga was looking like that falcon. And I sat down next to him at the piano, and I go, “Steve, it’s me.” And then he smiled real big, and we started cracking jokes and singing songs. And… And then after the show, we were backstage, and he asked me… he said, “What are you doing tomorrow?” I said, “I’m gonna fly to Detroit with you… pay my respects to Ms. Franklin.” At that time… a senator had just passed away. The late, greatJohn McCainhad passed away. And Stevie said, “I need you to do me a favor.” He said, “John McCain is laying in state at the Capitol.” He said, “I want you to go pay… our respects to him.” And I said, “Ni*ga, I would much rather go to Detroit with you.” And then Stevie gave me that look. He just looked like this, like… He didn’t even know I was all the way over here. So, I went. The next day, I went to the Capitol. I… I… I don’t do this for anyone but Stevie Wonder. He can tell me to do anything within reason. The only thing he’s told me to do that I won’t do is stop smoking. That I won’t do yet. But I did it. I waited in line, and then I got all the way up to Senator McCain’s casket, and I was just like, “Uh, Stevie Wonder sent me. Goodbye, ni*ga.” And I just walked off. But I… But that’s what he wanted, and so I did it. A lot of people don’t know this, but people from Washington know this, who are my age. A lot of people don’t know that Martin Luther King, unlike Charlie Kirk, had a harder time being remembered. That… the only reason that Martin Luther King’s birthday is a holiday is because the King family and Stevie Wonder lobbied very hard and very long for that holiday. That what they call “Black Happy Birthday, the Stevie Wonder “Happy Birthday,” was a protest song about making the King holiday a reality. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you And it was so effective. Finally, the Senate voted on it. Ninety-nine out of 100 senators agreed to make that birthday a holiday. Except for one… John McCain. The guy that Stevie sent me to say goodbye to. What a great man Stevie Wonder is. How much this country could learn… from a man like that. John McCain, God bless him… he got himself in a pickle for that vote, but it came back to get his ass years later. Years later, he was running for president and had to run against the first ni*ga to ever get a party nomination. And Barack Obama got that nomination on the anniversary of Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. And of all the votes in McCain’s long career as a senator, that vote against that King holiday had never haunted him like it did at that time. So, how did he counter that? I’ll tell you what he did. If you remember, John McCain sponsored a bill to pardon Jack Johnson posthumously of the Mann Act. Yes, he did sponsor that bill to pardon Jack Johnson of the Mann Act. The Mann Act ispreciselythe law that Sean “Puffy” Combs was convicted of just recently. America’s Unstoppable Ni*ga Act. Yeah, something else is going on, but I don’t know. Are you guys bored? Okay, I’m gonna keep going. There’s more. I hate conspiracy theories, but I’ll tell you one about… well… and this is not even a theory. This part I know is a fact. Did you know… when I left D.C. and moved to New York in the ’90s, that New York City Police Department had a hip-hop police task force? Did you know that? And this task force would follow anybody that was involved in hip-hop culture around. Not just rappers, drug dealers, ’cause they thought that it was connected somehow. Even young comedians like me. Anybody that was just on that scene, they knew who everybody was and what everybody was doing. And back in those days, I used to go to nightclubs, but sometimes I’d go to a club and the lights would be a little bit different. And I didn’t notice, but the O.G.s would pull me aside and be like, “Careful in the club, ni*ga. They got the FBI lights up.” Which meant that the lighting was strange ’cause the party was under surveillance and they were just telling me to watch my back. And, you know, I wasn’t doing anything wrong anyway, ni*ga, just having a good time. Now, did you know that that task force was invented originally to follow just two people around? Those people was a guy named Christopher Wallace, a.k.a. theNotorious B.I.G., andSean “P. Diddy” Combs. Now, why is that? That this ni*ga has been under surveillance for at least 30 years, but just now, just now they noticed that he racketeers and beats up bitches? I bet you, I bet you, if he was doing all that, I bet you they seen him doing it for a long time. It was strange, in this case, nobody called the police, except forKid Cudi. And everybody called Kid Cudi a snitch. But he wasn’t a snitch. A snitch is when two ni*gas do crime together and one of them gets caught and tells on the other one to get himself out of the trouble. Kid Cudi was violated by Puff. He alleged that Puff blew up his motherfucking Porsche with a Molotov cocktail and didn’t stop there. He said… He then alleged that Puff broke into his house… and opened this ni*ga’s Christmas gifts. Oh, ni*ga, I’d have been furious. Kid Cudi said, “I can’t prove that he opened the gifts or nothing, but I came in the house and he was in there and the gifts was open and that ni*ga was just like, ‘Merry Christmas, playboy.’ “ So what was Kid Cudi supposed to do? He only got two choices. Either A, you’re going to have to do some gangster shit to this ni*ga that he’s going to have a hard time proving. Or if you’re not built like that… and I do not believe that Kid Cudi is built like that… your last option is B… you gotta call the police. And good for Kid Cudi. He did the right thing. I, on the other hand, oh, I’m built like that. If this ni*ga fuck my family’s Christmas up, you better believe I’m gonna make him suffer for that shit. A ni*ga’s gonna come up to me and tell me all about it and not even know I did it. “Oh, my God, Dave! Did you hear what happened to Puffy?” “Oh, my God, no. What happened?” “He was jogging by himself in Topanga Canyon. A falcon came out of nowhere and killed this ni*ga!” I love hip-hop music. I love many of the people that make that music. They taught me things and showed me things that I’d never seen for myself, good things. For example, I was in Atlanta once. I’m almost done. Hang in there, champ… I was in Atlanta… and a rapper named T.I… called me up. Now, at this time, I didn’t know him well, I know him better now, but I knew him well enough that he’d had my phone number. And the ni*ga called me up, he was like, “Dave, I heard you was in my city.” He said, “I want to show you the real Atlanta.” I said, “Fuck yeah, ni*ga, let’s go.” He said, “Meet me downstairs in your hotel valet.” So I went downstairs. I thought he was fucking around, but when I went down there, he was outside in the valet, sitting in a purple Phantom. This car must have been a million and a half dollars. Beautiful purple color with ivory-white seats. It’s the kind of car that you gotta have a chauffeur to drive, but for some reason, this ni*ga was driving it himself. And I didn’t ask no questions. I just jumped in the car and, man, he showed me Atlanta, everything. “Outkast and them started rapping over there and Future used to play in the playground over here.” And then he slowed the car up and he pointed to a house and he goes… “And Martin Luther King grew up in that house right there. And he raised his children over here. And that’s the church he preached in over there.” And then… we stopped at a red light, and these little Black kids rushed the car from either side of the intersection with water bottles. These kids in Atlanta, if you know, they’re called the Water Boys. Their whole hustle is they sell water to people who are stuck in that hot Atlanta traffic. I didn’t know that. I just saw these young ni*gas running up on the car, so I locked the door like, “Fuck that.” But T.I. rolled his window down, started giving the kids orders. “Slow down, don’t just run up on somebody’s car. You don’t know what they got in there.” “And smile so you look less threatening. And remember your manners. ‘Yes, sir. No, ma’am. Please, thank you.'” “That’ll keep you alive.” “And keep that condensation on that water so it looks refreshing and delicious.” And then that kid realized that he was talking to a legend. He said, “Oh, my God.” He said, “Thanks, T.I.” And held his hand out for some money. And that ni*ga T.I. looked at him and said, “I done gave you the game,” and rolled up the window and drove away. That night… I did my show… and when I got off stage, T.I. was backstage with a friend of his that I didn’t know. I just knew his friend was somebody, because everyone was acting all excited that he was back there. So I asked him, I go, “Yo, Tip, who’s your man?” And he’s like, “Oh, that right there?” He goes, “That there is the future of hip-hop.” And I was like, “Ni*ga, will you just calm down?” So then I asked the dude. I said, “What’s your name?” And the dude looked over, he said… he said, “I’m Nipsey.” And this wasNipsey Hussle. Not gonna go all into it, but I gotta tell you, that night… that night, me and T.I. and Nipsey went out… and we had a fucking blast. Good time, not freak-off fun, but fun. So much so that when I got home from the road, and my wife always asks me, she goes, “Dave, how was your trip?” Normally I’m just like, “It was good.” But this time I was like, “Babe, babe, I met the coolest ni*ga.” I said, “This ni*ga’s younger than me, but it’s like he’s older than me.” And she’s like, “Wha… What?” She goes, “What does that mean?” And I was like, “I don’t know, bitch. He’s like… It’s like hanging out with a fortune cookie. This ni*ga just had an answer for everything.” I told her all about Nipsey. What was funny about it is years later, I saw Nipsey’s widow and she pulled me aside. I’d never met her. And she said, “I just want to tell you that my husband loved you.” She said, “He said he met you in Atlanta and you had a wonderful time.” I said, “Boy, that’s fucking crazy. We sure did.” Not long after I met Nipsey, I was in L.A. doing a show. And then after the show, I got a text from a guy that says, “I’m at a party you need to be at.” And I was like, “I’m gonna go to bed.” And he’s like, “No, ni*ga, youhaveto come to this party.” So I’m thinking this must be the freak-off, finally. And the party was at a place that I’d been to a million times. So I wasn’t excited about being in that place. But when I walked in, it just was different. It was popping. And it turns out that the party was for Nipsey. Nipsey had been nominated for Rap Album of the Year, and everyone that he would have ever respected was at the party. T.I. was there, Snoop was there, Jay-Z was there, Puffy, before we knew he did all that stuff, was there. I was there, on and on and on. And as good as the party was when I was partying, I was having fun, but I had a pit in my stomach ’cause it reminded me of the ’90s. And you can believe me or you cannot believe me. I’m just telling you how I saw and how I felt. They had the FBI… the FBI lights up. I just felt like, “Man, this party’s under surveillance,” but I didn’t think too much of it. And then I went back home to Ohio, and I was taking a nap, and my wife shook me awake and she had tears in her eyes and she said, “David.” I said, “What’s going on with you?” She said, “Your friend is dead.” And I’m old now, so I’m like, “Bitch, you’re gonna have to be more specific than that.” I know ni*gas with gout. But it was Nipsey. And this is why I feel for Charlie Kirk’s fans because I know what it’s like to see someone you look up to and admire gunned down by a fucking nobody. Oh, my God. It’s so hard to accept that. And if you looked on the internet and… and saw all those terrible videos, because there was a very gory video of Nipsey’s murder too. And then I… I looked in the comments section, and… and the internet was doing what it does, and everyone was coming up with one conspiracy theory after another, but the one that I kept seeing the most involved a holistic doctor in New York City. Have you heard it? It’s a doctor namedDr. Sebi. In the mid’90s, during the height of the AIDS epidemic, a Black holistic doctor in New York named Dr. Sebi claimed that he cured two people of AIDS and HIV holistically. And at that time, that was an illegal claim to make in the United States because of the FDA. So the federal government took Dr. Sebi to court and New York State took Dr. Sebi to court. And Dr. Sebi beat both cases. And Nipsey Hussle, unbeknownst to many, was making a documentary, he was producing it, about Dr. Sebi’s work and his life. And people on the internet believe that larger powers killed Nipsey Hussle to keep that information from you and I. I don’t know. I honestly don’t know. But I’ll tell you something that I do know. The greatest comedian I’ve ever seen with my own eyes isCharlie Barnett. Charlie Barnett, a New York street comedy legend. He only did comedy on the streets, and I was lucky enough to meet him. He was a mentor of mine. Charlie Barnett was so good at performing on the streets that from the streets, he booked himself a job onSaturday Night Live.Yeah, but the week of rehearsals, they found out that he couldn’t read. So they fired him and replaced him withEddie Murphy. Oh, it could have been beautiful. But you gotta be able to read to doSaturday Night Live.I know y’all saw Bad Bunny last week. I’m not knocking him, but that ni*ga’s reading, you know what I mean? Charlie Barnett wasn’t deterred. He kept pushing. And he went on to do movies likeD.C. Cab,which is where I first saw him. He used to be onMiami Vice.This motherfucker became a star in his own right. But the thing that kept derailing him is that Charlie was a terrible drug addict. This ni*ga started doing crack to quit heroin. He was doomed. He learned how to do street comedy from a guy namedSwami X, and Swami X didn’t just teach him how to do comedy, he taught him how to get high, and Charlie never could shake it. And when Charlie mentored me, even though he was a terrible drug addict, I never saw him high. He never wanted to do to me what Swami did to him. He made sure I understood that cocaine is just not for you even though those bitches are prettier than them ugly weed bitches you be hanging out with. One night, I saw Charlie in a comedy club and he looked terrible. And this guy would avoid me if he was getting high, but I’d never seen him look this bad. So I said to him, I said, “Charlie, you good?” And he didn’t say anything. And I said, “Are you high?” And he laughed. He said, “No, ni*ga, I’m not high.” He said, “I’m dying.” And he said, “I’m dying. I have AIDS. And I’m dying.” Now, I must’ve been 18 or 19. I’d never met nobody that I knew of that had AIDS. But I got to tell you, that… that shit had me shook. And then I started thinking of all his jokes. And he was hinting at it for years. Didn’t he used to have a joke where he said, “I took an AIDS test yesterday. I got a 65.” Another time he was on stage at the Apollo, and he told the crowd, “There’s good and bad in everything.” And the crowd was like, “Yeah.” He said, “So what’s good about crack?” And, you know, everybody in Harlem was like, “Nothing.” And he said, “Shit, crack brought the price of pussy down to five dollars!” But when he said he had AIDS, I was so shocked that I looked at him to see if he was joking. And I knew, I said, “He’s… He’s serious.” And I said, “Fuck that shit.” He said, “What you mean?” I said, “You’re not going to die around me, ni*ga. That’s not your destiny.” He said, “What are you talking about?” And I took Charlie Barnett to Dr. Sebi. This is a fact. And Dr. Sebi treated Charlie Barnett for three months. This is a crazy story. I could make a whole movie about it. It’s a long story, so I’ll spare you. But the point of the story is, Charlie died of AIDS. D.C., no matter how much this government or anyone else puts pressure on you, keep your wits about you. I’m here just to remind you that we are a community, and we will stay sane together. We will take care of each other, and we will wait this orange ni*ga out. The fear that I have for myself that I need you to protect me from is cooption. My voice has become more powerful than I intended it to be, and I cannot let these ni*gas do me like Charlie Kirk, or even worse than that. What if these ni*gas trip me up somehow, coopt me, and then make me say the things that they want me to say? Well, we can’t have that. So, just in case, we need a code. It’s gotta be something that I can say so that if I say it, you know that these ni*gas got me. And don’t listen to nothing that I say after I say those words. But don’t tell anybody what it is, but it’s gotta be something that, you know what I mean, that I would never say. Oh, I know what the code is. The code word is, “I stand with Israel.” Thank you very much, and good night. I’ve always come to the conclusion That “but” is the way Of asking for permission To lay something heavy on one’s head So I have tried to not be the one Who’ll fall into that line But what I feel inside I think you should know OhAnd baby, that’s you, you, you ‘Cause you’ve brought Some joy inside my tears What no one thought could be You’ve brought some joy I’ve always felt that tomorrow is for Those who are too much afraid And start living for today I feel that lasting moments are coming Of the happiness that you bring Baby, baby, it’s you, you, you You’ve brought some joy What no one thought could be You’ve brought some joy You’ve brought some joy You’ve brought some joy Doo, doo, do, do, do, do You’ve brought some joy What no one thought could be This show was like watching a paranoid stoned chain smoking friend rattle off his favorite pet theories.

    "transcript":"Part of the ProblemEpisode number:1306Premiered:September 20, 2025 Dave Smith brings you the latest in politics! On this episode of Part Of The Problem, Dave discusses his new opinions about Jimmy Kimmel being fired for his Charlie Kirk comments, how this plays into the broader values of libertarianism, and more. What’s up? What’s up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode ofPart of the Problem.I am Dave Smith. I am rolling solo for this episode. Thank you guys so much for joining. I really appreciate it. I’ve got some stuff that’s on my mind that I thought I would rant about today. And it’s something that I’ve been—you know, I talked a bit about this over the last week. And we talked a bit on the members-only stream about it yesterday. So we were talking a bit yesterday about the firing of Jimmy Kimmel and a little bit of a larger conversation about free speech. Over the last week there’s been all types of these topics coming up. First of all, the fact that Charlie Kirk stood for free speech so much and that he was executed for that—in many ways for that. Then there have been conversations about people getting fired for TikTok videos they make celebrating it. Now this Jimmy Kimmel one has really been kind of the biggest example in all of this. And then there’s another interesting angle, because of course the chairman of the FCC really blatantly threatened ABC before they fired Jimmy Kimmel. So it just adds in other elements. Now there’s a big conversation raging about right-wing cancel culture, free speech, government intervention, hypocrisy of the people who have been opposed to cancel culture now celebrating it. A lot of different people are giving their takes on this. And I just want to say—I think I have a little bit of a different take the more I’ve been thinking about this than anyone else I’ve seen so far. Perhaps I’m wrong, but I think it’s different than anyone I’ve seen so far. In other words, this rant is guaranteed to satisfy no one. But I still think it’s important. So let me go in saying that. And I would preface the entire thing by saying I’m not—on this episode I’m not trying to convince you of anything. I’m not trying to—as I often am—but on this one, I’m not trying to convince you that I’m right and you’re wrong, or this is the correct way to think about it and this is the incorrect way to think about it. I’m not trying to sell you on anything today. I’m trying to give you something to play with and give you something to grapple with, and kind of maybe, you know, perhaps think about these things in a different way. It’s kind of interesting, I guess, for libertarians like myself when there are these moments when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it seems like normies care about talking about our values. This almost always only happens when liberals are attempting to use your own values against you. So, you know, this happens a lot. Like whenever there’s a liberal who’s threatened by cancel culture, they immediately go, “Oh, free speech, you don’t believe in government intervention,” or something like that. It’s in the same sense like when they’re standing up for abortion, they saymy body, my choice.They make a libertarian appeal, but they only care about it as far as it serves their interests. And then obviously they will abandon that. But you know, literally I remember hearing pro-choice activists saymy body, my choiceas they supported vax mandates in the middle of the pandemic. It doesn’t bother them that they’re being hypocritical, because they’re just attempting to manipulate you. And I guess I would start by saying this—kind of like to zoom out about the moment that we’re in right now, which is particularly what’s appalling to me about the liberals who are trying to needle right-wingers for celebrating Jimmy Kimmel being fired, or for celebrating even just people who lost their job for making TikTok videos and stuff like that. I think it’s worth saying at the beginning of this that the way I see things in the big picture here is that the most remarkable part of, say, the last week—since Charlie Kirk’s assassination—the most amazing part of all of this is that there’s been no violent retaliation. And that’s really great. Like it’s really, really good. That was the most important, the most dangerous part of this moment, and the biggest potential for disaster and escalation. And there’s been no retaliation. Right-wing America, broadly speaking, deserves a lot of credit for that. A lot of credit. There have been a lot of influential right-wing people who have encouraged calm and discouraged any type of retaliation. And there’s also, obviously, Christianity is a major force in the right wing in the United States of America. Whatever else, everybody involved in not having a violent response to this deserves a lot of credit. So in this moment, when there’s tremendous anger, tremendous frustration, tremendous pain on the right wing in America, the fact that there hasn’t been any type of violent response should be, I think, applauded. Instead, the reaction is to be mad at them for celebrating the fact that this disgusting Jimmy Kimmel got kicked off of the air. I just think that’s an unreasonable standard to place on right-wing America. I mean, look, dude, whenGeorge Floydgot killed, there were billions of dollars in property damage done as a response, and dozens of people were killed, and hundreds at least were assaulted and injured and things like that. There was a lot of violence in response to that. There’s been none in response to Charlie Kirk. And Charlie Kirk was not like a career criminal who died by some freak thing. However you feel—I know, we’re not even going to get into that, I know there’s the competing autopsy reports and all these other things and you can feel however you feel about a cop putting his knee on a guy’s neck and all of that—but like if a cop did that to a hundred people in a row, it is unlikely that anyone would die from it. It’s a little bit of a freak thing that that would end up killing you. Again, not saying you shouldn’t do that or nothing like that, not saying I want anyone to do that to me or I want to do that to anyone else. But what you had was a career criminal, a man who had—what was it, he had robbed a pregnant woman or something like that—and you know, okay, by the way, none of that means you should be mistreated by a cop or anything. But the point is that Charlie Kirk never did nothing like that. Kirk was just a Christian who liked to go to college campuses and talk, and he didn’t happen to die by something that normally won’t kill you. He was executed by something that will kill you 100% of the time. So just saying—the fact that there’s been no violence in response, you’d think that ought to be something that would be at the top of everyone’s list. Like, okay, that’s the most important thing, kudos for that. But that’s not what’s going on here. Instead, this seems to be an attempt at a rallying cry of like, “Oh, Jimmy Kimmel was a victim, he’s a free speech warrior who was persecuted for standing up to the regime,” or something like that. And you know, like Stephen Colbert, he said the other day,we are all Jimmy Kimmel now,which is really—I mean there is something to that. I was making this point on the members-only stream yesterday. But like, that’s your comment? We’re all Jimmy Kimmel now? Not we’re all Charlie Kirk? We’re all Jimmy Kimmel? Like you see that as the most egregious violation of free speech in the last week? ‘Cause I thought it was the guy who went to college campuses to talk about ideas and got executed. Anyway, I want to talk a little bit about how I think about these things. Again, I’m not trying to sell you — I’m just trying to give you this to pick around and see what you think. Often I think for people in the position I’m in — podcaster or pundit or commentator — we tend to think that our views on policy are the most important thing, whereas I think typically for podcasters or pundits, the way you’re thinking about things is the most important thing. The way you talk about things with other people, the way you get people thinking about things is actually much more important than even what policy you stand for, because if we’re being honest, we’re not in the business of making policy. That doesn’t really matter, but we are in the business of getting people to think about things. So in some ways that’s more important. Now, by the way, to protect my libertarian street cred here — and I mean this — I’m against the FCC existing. I’m against the FCC threatening companies. I think it was counterproductive and just wrong and incredibly stupid for the FCC chair to start threatening ABC the way he did. In some ways it takes away what otherwise would be a win for right-wingers. It’s almost like cheating at a game that you can win straight up. If you cheat, you just took that away from yourself getting the clean win and now everyone can see that you cheated and it almost doesn’t count the same way. You should have just let me get the win. That’s kind of how I feel about this whole thing. But I don’t necessarily agree with some other libertarians who are arguing that Jimmy Kimmel’s free speech is being violated here. This might upset some people when I say it, but I’ll try to explain my thinking. Once again, I’m not exactly trying to convince you. I’m more just trying to think about things together. I would say that Jimmy Kimmel is, in effect and function, part of the regime, and he has been for a long time now. I view things differently. I don’t view the regime as having rights the way all the rest of us do. It’s almost like if you kidnapped a child and then someone stole that child from you — have you been victimized? Obviously the answer is no. Even though a child was taken from you, it wasn’t your child to begin with, so you’re not the victim here. You joined the criminal kidnapper class and now someone else in the criminal kidnapper class out-criminals you. You don’t care — you’re not a victim anymore in this game because you already crossed that line. In the same sense, if you’re somebody who’s against murder — as most of us should be — but the Bloods and the Crips start killing each other, it’s not the same as the Bloods killing innocent people. Two gangs fighting it out is different than gangs terrorizing innocent people. I almost view things like that: two gangs I don’t like are fighting it out. In that case, you want to think more about being strategic than any moral consideration. If two groups of killers are killing each other and one group vows that once they’re done killing this gang they’ll stop, and the other says as soon as we’re done killing this gang we’re going to kill all the rest of you, you might root for the first gang because there’s no principle involved anymore — it’s all killers at this point. I’m not randomly assigning “regime” to Jimmy Kimmel. I think he joined the regime a long time ago. For anybody — not just libertarians, but anyone opposed to the current regime — it’s important to think about things this way. I remember back around 2010, shortly after I got into political stuff and the Ron Paul revolution blew my mind and I started reading radical political books. In the first couple years there was theSchool Sucks Podcast— Brett Veinotte? — apologies, I liked those guys. They had a viral video that blew my mind. This was early on the internet; YouTube wasn’t as big then. The video might have had a couple hundred thousand views, but it felt huge. It was a different world. It blew my mind and I had to read about it, and it turns out a lot of it was true. It’s probably a red-pill moment for me. Basically, what he was talking about was his interest in the rise of the Nazis and how the hell that happened in Germany. There’s lots to the story, but here’s one part that rarely comes up: about a hundred years before the rise of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, there was the Prussian Empire — the geographic and cultural precursor to Nazi Germany. The Prussian Empire was the second Reich; Adolf Hitler tried to start the Third Reich. The Prussians were having a big problem where their conscripted soldiers would do crazy things like run away, piss themselves and then get killed on the battlefield, or refuse to fight. That was a major problem for the Prussian elites. And they ultimately came up with a solution for the problem. Their solution was that they would start what became known as school. The idea was that they would get your kids at a really young age and school them to be loyal subjects of the king. So by the time they were 17, 18 years old, they had been totally propagandized by the government. They would be loyal subjects to the king, go fight in his wars, and not think about silly little things like themselves and whether they wanted to do this. By all accounts, it was largely successful — so successful that it was exported to the United States of America. This is why we still call it school. I don’t know if you’ve ever thought about that before, but you’re like, “Why is it all these German-sounding names? Why am I dropping my five-year-old off at kindergarten?” It’s because that’s where it comes from. And Horace Mann, the godfather of American education, explicitly wrote about this — that we are adopting the Prussian system because it’s so effective for the Prussians. He had some line in there about, “Well, they use it for autocratic means, but we will use it for good Republican means,” something like that. But if you just look at it for what it is — and this is why it was kind of a powerful red-pill moment, at least especially for me in 2010 — you’re like, “Oh my god, this whole thing is a brainwashing mechanism.” If libertarians are going to conceive of the existence of the state, you can’t not think about that too. Like, oh my god, this is a whole huge other component of it. Tom Woods had this great speech right around that time too, around 2010. It was the first time I ever heard him use this analogy. He was talking about government school and said: think about it. By the way, they didn’t call them education centers, they called it school. What they’re doing there is not educating, they’re schooling you. Tom Woods’ thought experiment went like this: just imagine that Walmart ran all the schools. Imagine it’s anyone except the government. Imagine a private company running the schools. Walmart is in charge of all the schools, and the first thing they have your kids do every morning, from age 5 to 18, is pledge allegiance to Walmart. Then in the classroom there would be pictures of all the Walmart CEOs around the classroom, and they’d make up all of these stories. Like, the first Walmart CEO was such a pure man he never told a lie. One time he chopped down a cherry tree and said, “Dad, I did it, I could not lie to you.” Obviously, this is made-up shit about what heroes and wonderful people they were. “This Walmart CEO was the great emancipator,” and so on. Meanwhile, if you look back, you’d find a lot of them killed a whole lot of people and did messed-up stuff, and in fact they all told a lot of lies. But if Walmart was praising Walmart and making young children pledge allegiance to Walmart, we would all immediately look at it and say, “This is sick. This is cult-like behavior.” But that just is normal to all of us when it comes to the state, because that’s just the way it’s supposed to be done. Over the last decade or so, a lot of people started coming to the conclusion: “Oh my god, public schools have been turned into indoctrination centers.” And it’s like, no, they have not been turned into indoctrination centers. They have switched up the indoctrination curriculum to something more particularly egregious to you — and understandably so. But nothing’s changed. They’re just indoctrinating them, because that’s been the goal the whole time. This has to be understood along with the more fundamental, 101 libertarian understanding of what the government is. You’d think it’s a pretty important thing to understand, but liberalism in many ways is allergic to this understanding. Still, it’s the foundational libertarian insight about politics. And it’s not even particularly libertarian in nature — it’s just objectively true. This is why, when people have these conversations — “Well, it’s different if private people do it, or if the government is involved, it violates the First Amendment if the government is involved, but it doesn’t if it’s not the government,” and all that — I think very few people in this broader conversation have really examined the foundational building blocks. So number one: what is the government? What is the state? As libertarians know well, there’s only one coherent, objective definition for government. Government is a group of people who hold a legal monopoly on the use of aggressive violence. That really is the only definition that actually describes what it is. You can do pretty much anything a government can do except the aggressive violence. You can even, in most parts of this country, use violence to defend yourself. You just can’t do it aggressively. You can’t use aggression — and they can. That’s the difference. I mean, you could write laws. You could even come up with a tax code. You just can’t enforce it. They can enforce it. If you were to do what the government does, it would be considered theft, murder, threats, imprisonment, kidnapping, torture. When they do it, it’s called war, taxation, collateral damage, detainment, official letters from a court. But if you did it, you’d be arrested — and so, okay, this is essentially the nature of government. To be a libertarian is to reject that and to embrace something else, but to understand that is just to get things correct. That objectively is what the government does. If any private individual did what the government does, they would be arrested and spend a long time in jail if not get the death penalty. So when you’re talking about the government, you’re talking about an instrument of force. There is a tremendous tendency, particularly among liberals, to pretend that government is something else — that government is the referee in the game or that government is all of us collectively or that government is the nation. None of that’s true. You could disprove it just by thinking it through. Murray Rothbard, in his phenomenal workAnatomy of the State— which I highly recommend everyone read if you haven’t — makes the point that the government is essentially a gang that took over and gained legitimacy in the popular imagination of its people. That’s essentially all the government is. But it’s more than just the actual government. He gets into the marriage between the government and the intellectual class and how there’s a huge reinforcement mechanism between the two. The intellectual class doesn’t command much value in a true marketplace — you probably won’t become a multimillionaire off teaching sociology. However, when the government builds public universities and libraries and backs student loans, they make a market for these intellectuals that’s much more lucrative than the market otherwise would be. In return, the intellectuals find a way to justify the role of the state. Much like school itself, the role these intellectuals play is essentially brainwashing — propagandizing the country into accepting the regime’s policy. Thinking of them as separate from the state is substantially less helpful and accurate than thinking of them as part of one apparatus. Curtis Yarvin called this the “cathedral” — encompassing the actual government, all the shadow parts of the government, corporate media, academia, Hollywood — because they’re all used together. Take academia: many people who work at private universities are not government employees, but the whole industry is a government program. The whole thing only exists because the government backs the loans or gives legal protections to the schools, and it ends with everybody spouting approved government propaganda. If you think about it like this: remember when it came out that the NIH was funding gain-of-function research in the Wuhan lab in China? Well, it wasn’t them, right? If you remember, it was a subsidiary. They gave a grant to a company, that company gave the money to the Wuhan lab. But I think all of us should feel comfortable saying the NIH gave that money to the Wuhan lab. Because if you don’t conceive of it that way, then all you’re acknowledging is that all the government has to do is say, “Well, we gave it to—” all they have to do is have a private company do it and then say, “That was done by a private company, it wasn’t done by us.” We’d all kind of recognize that’s pretty ridiculous, right? I mean, imagine there was a secret act passed by our government to create another government department, but it was secret, and they didn’t tell the public it was a government department. Would that make it any less of a government department? In other words, does it matter what we call it, or what the government calls it? Or does it matter what function they’re serving right now? Especially with college campus stuff — if you’re being funded by the government, your whole industry is propped up by the government, and you’re regurgitating government propaganda. Okay, in some technical sense you’re a private person who isn’t a government employee. But in a much more real sense, you are part of the regime and should be regarded as such. This is how all types of things work. A great book on this to read isConfessions of an Economic Hit Man.Great book. It talks all about the private companies the CIA uses to do their dirty work. If we’re going to say that’s not the government, then I don’t know — you’re just giving the government an obvious end-around. There are no restrictions on government at all, because the thing is obviously still a part of it. It’s the same as what they say about the Federal Reserve. “The Federal Reserve is private.” What are you talking about? There’s a private company we created through an act of Congress. They just happen to have the power to print the money. But what is that? Let’s use Walmart again. Say Walmart was created by an act of Congress, and every few years the president appointed the CEO of Walmart. Would you consider Walmart a private company at that point, or would you go, “I think you’re part of the government now”? Same thing with weapons contractors. What is the Brookings Institute? Is that just a private organization? Does it make sense to think of them as such when they’re funded by a mix of foreign governments and weapons manufacturers? That makes them a private company? No — not really, not in any true spirit, not in any true sense of that term. Another example: NGOs. Isn’t it interesting the first two words they have to put arenon-governmental? If you ever start a company, you probably wouldn’t think those need to be the first two words of your company, because it’s actually non-governmental, so you don’t need to say it. But NGOs take U.S. taxpayer money and go form pro-democracy Ukrainian media companies that urge people to take to the streets to overthrow the Yanukovych government. Am I supposed to look at that George Soros NGO as just the free market? So again, I do think you come back to a thing where — I’m not saying it’s perfect, and obviously it’s a little bit arbitrary in some cases what exactly you consider the regime and what you don’t. But just for example, let’s say, hypothetically, in Washington, D.C. you had a think tank funded by weapons manufacturers that argued for war. Now, I know that’s crazy, we’d never find that in the real Washington, D.C. But let’s just say hypothetically there was a think tank funded by weapons companies going to government with policy papers saying why we need a big buildup in the defense budget. Here you have weapons companies — creatures of the taxpayer. They literally just sell their weapons to the U.S. federal government, which buys them with our money — money they took from us by force. The weapons company creates or funds a think tank. The think tank argues for more of our money to be spent on weapons. Now let’s say, hypothetically, a president or a dictator or a politician — someone who’s an official government employee — says, “I’m proposing a new law.” That you’re not allowed to do that. Like, Mr. Think Tank guy, shut up. You’re not allowed to write papers anymore that say you want a higher defense budget. Is it so obvious that the libertarian position in pure theory and morality is that that’s a violation of free speech? I actually don’t think so. I don’t think so at that point. Now, I understand, I can hear the pushback already. Remember, I’m trying to get you to play with an idea. I’m not trying to sell you on anything. And people can say, “Well, that’s not Jimmy Kimmel exactly.” You know, I think when you’re really at Jimmy Kimmel’s level — especially through COVID — when he’s at that position where he decides,I’m going to stop being a comedian and I’m going to start being a mouthpiece for the regime. I’m going to literally mock my fellow Americans, advocate that they don’t get health care if they haven’t gotten the COVID vax…Remember, what did he say? “You can go die now, wheezy,” or whatever his comments were. You do put yourself in a different category, in my opinion. You made yourself part of the cathedral. In the same sense, if you came to me and said, “Oh my god, there’s a strongman political leader going up there and saying these think tanks who are taking money from weapons companies and advocating for more war, we’re shutting them all down,” would you say this is a violation of free speech? I don’t know. I don’t think so. Actually, I think this is gangster [__]. These are two gangs fighting and I have every right to not care about that. And if you were to ask me, “Oh, Mr. Libertarian, I thought you like free speech,” I’d be like, “Well, I don’t think they’re—” you know what I mean? Like, I don’t think any of this should exist. I don’t think that weapons company should exist. I don’t think that think tank should exist. And I don’t think this politician should exist. But you know what? They all do. So it’s not so clear from first principles that I’ve got to think these members of the regime are citizens exercising their free speech. I just do not see it that way. And I understand where people can disagree. Like I said, it is kind of arbitrary when exactly somebody becomes a member of the regime. And I guess to that I would kind of say: yeah, there are lines that are arbitrary that must be drawn in society. You know, it’s not exactly clear when the age of consent should be. Should you be allowed to have sex and drive a car at 18 or 19 or 20? I don’t know. But there’s got to be a line. Somewhere around there seems just about right. I mean, you could say eight-year-olds can’t be allowed to drive a car and 35-year-olds certainly can. Where do we draw that line exactly? You try to get it as close to right as you think. I’m sure we could all look at some line and go, “No, that’s way too young,” or, “No, that’s way too old.” But you have to draw it somewhere. You have to, because otherwise you can’t move forward. You can’t have a society where children operate vehicles and you can’t have a society where adults are not allowed to. So for function, you have to draw the line somewhere. And yes, it’s going to be somewhat arbitrary where you draw it. I think Jimmy Kimmel was way over the line — way over the line of just being a member of the regime. I don’t consider that speech rights anymore at that point. I’m not one of these people who’s like, “Oh my god, I have so much sympathy for Jimmy Kimmel because his First Amendment rights were violated.” I just don’t think that’s correct. I still think it’s really stupid and a bad direction to go down. So essentially, this is why I’m going to make nobody satisfied with this argument. I say all of that to say I still am — if you ask me what policy I support — I think it was a disaster that the FCC chairman gave them that out. What the FCC chairman did was some real gangster []. He literally said, “We could either handle this the easy way or the hard way.” You don’t have to jump — it’s not a crazy stretch to get from “we could either handle this the easy way or the hard way” to gangster []. That’s what they were doing. Now, I don’t think in this case that’s actually why Jimmy Kimmel got fired. I think Jimmy Kimmel got fired because a big corporation jumped on the opportunity. All the outrage about the dumbass thing he said gave them the perfect out. You have outrage, affiliates threatening, and then the FCC chair threatens — perfect. Now we can dump this big contract which wasn’t justified anyway. People have a tough time thinking in second- and third-order effects. To my point, this is no longer, to me, a moral liberty issue. This is morally wrong for the government to get involved this way. To me, these are different wings of the government fighting; that’s essentially how I view this. That happens all the time. People make the mistake of thinking of the state as a monolith. It’s not. There are examples where the State Department and the Defense Department are at odds. The CIA and the FBI have had a contentious relationship. Different presidential administrations feud, and there are beefs within administrations. It’s not a single unitary thing. I’m saying I think of this more as a feud between the CIA and the FBI. Is anyone’s rights being violated? I don’t know. You’re all in a constant, perpetual state of violating people’s rights, so I don’t know. So it’s not a moral issue. Then what it becomes is purely a strategic issue, and purely on strategic grounds it only hurt the right wing. What I was saying before with the Rosie Perez thing is that people have a tough time understanding second- and third-order effects and how things play out in the long run. It’s much more challenging to look at that than to just go, “What’s the immediate next step?” Rosie Perez’s dumb line inWhite Men Can’t Jumpwas: sometimes when you win, you really lose, and sometimes when you lose, you really win. Sometimes when you tie, you actually win or lose, and sometimes when you win or lose, you actually tie. The point being that in this situation, Jimmy Kimmel was getting [__] up. He was already losing the fight. If you were in a big fight, dominating the opponent — going into the 12th round up 11 rounds to nothing — and you’re like, “I’m just going to keep killing this guy,” do you want the referee to cheat for you at that point? No. It robs your victory. It gives them a talking point. Jimmy Kimmel was getting destroyed. His ratings have been tanking. The guy is a laughingstock. Nobody cares anymore. He’s just getting dunked on left and right because his point was the most dumbass, bonehead point. It didn’t even make sense. His argument was, “Oh, MAGA is trying to make it look like it wasn’t one of their own.” Like, no, they’re not. It clearly wasn’t. There’s no evidence pointing to that. It’s as silly as any other conspiracy. But think about how you just took that victory away from yourself because the dumbass [__] FCC chairman had to go threatening them, and now they can make it out to be a free speech issue. So just purely on strategy, this was a bad move. I see a few things. A lot of people understandably just want to celebrate this, and they’re kind of like, “I don’t care. You guys started playing this game, so we’re going to play this game too.” I’ve heard a few popular people — people I like — making that attitude:That’s right, we are hypocrites. We’re being hypocritical now. We’re violating free speech. We’re embracing cancel culture. First of all, as I said before with my cathedral\/regime worldview, I don’t even think that’s true. So I don’t think there’s any need to concede you’re being a hypocrite in this case. But on top of that, when people are going, “Oh, Charlie Kirk, that’s what he was doing. We tried it that way and you shot that guy in the neck, so now we’re doing it this way” — first of all, I don’t think it’s a great way to honor the guy’s legacy to say, “We’re going to reject everything he stood for.” And second of all, what you’re leaving out is that we were finally winning. The anti-woke culture war has finally been paying off over the last few years. A big part of why they were able to win is because they could make the principled argument and win a lot of people over based off that. So even though I’m telling you I don’t actually view it as such a simple free speech issue, it is going to be perceived that way by most people. And once you go, “Yeah, we’re not being principled either,” then you no longer can persuade the people who are persuaded by principle. That’s one big thing to keep in mind. It’s important to keep in mind that we were winning this battle. Jimmy Kimmel was losing. Charlie Kirk was winning. Charlie Kirk flipped the youth vote so much that it got Donald Trump elected and had him win the popular vote for the first time after getting killed in that demographic. He’s now winning that demographic. That demographic doesn’t even know who Jimmy Kimmel is, by the way, because that’s how much the old dinosaur media has been getting killed. So it feels like, on one hand, strategically you’re just giving them a talking point and snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory. You’re already winning this — just keep winning this game. Obviously, for a lot of people out there, I gave the right wing credit for there being no retaliatory violence so far. For many people that might feel good to do that in the short run, but in the long run that’s a disaster. In the long run, it’s such a moral victory for the right wing that there was no violent response. That’s something that will persuade a lot of reasonable people: you keep saying they’re the bad guys, but actually they’re the ones who really showed restraint here. That’s how you win long term. All right, guys. Let’s take a moment and thank our sponsor for today’s show, which is KSHI. I’ve been telling you guys about KSHI for a little while. It is a regulated prediction market where people trade on real-world events — politics, sports, even weather forecasts. Right now, the New York City mayoral race is the hot ticket. Millions are wagering on who will take City Hall come November. Mayor Donnie is the front runner. The KSHI markets are currently giving him an 82% chance of winning. One reason I like checking KSHI is because these are real markets backed by money — where people are putting their money, which is always a better predictor than just about anything else. Go check them out: kshi.com. Over five million users are trading on politics, culture, even the weather. Use promo code PROBLEM at kshi.com. All right, let’s get back into the show. I understand feeling this way, particularly after everything that’s happened in the last week and a day. There’s a temptation to feel like, hey, things have gotten so far that I don’t want to hear, “Oh, we can’t embrace this or this could be used against us.” This is already being used against us. This is one area where I really will defend the libertarians, and I think they end up getting dismissed by right wingers. And I think — look, I’m a libertarian, but I’m the first to admit when there are areas where libertarians are being goofy and right wingers are actually making a point. This is one area where I really think libertarians have consistently been proven right, and still their advice never gets heard. It really is true that you do not want to set precedents that this model is how things are going to work. Top-down government managing of these things or government intervention in these issues never ends up being a friend of right wingers in the long run. Perhaps sometimes in the very short run, but even if you think about the Bud Light boycott, the Target boycott, or Elon Musk buying Twitter, it was always market-based actions that actually worked to roll back some of this insanity. After 9\/11 and in the following years, it was Ron Paul and the libertarians who were warning right wingers against the Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security, the TSA, and the massive spying apparatus that was built up over the decades. Right wingers at the time were like, “No, screw you libertarian [__], we’re doing this because we’ve got a threat and we’re gonna go get that threat. We’re gonna go get the Muslims.” And that entire apparatus ended up being turned on right-wing Americans. The Department of Homeland Security decided that domestic terrorism was the biggest threat and that MAGA Republicans were the domestic terrorists. Look at the way they went after the people on January 6th. Most right wingers now would probably admit, “Yeah, you guys were right about that one. We should have listened when you said this will be weaponized against us.” And then the next time libertarians say, “Yeah, dude, you don’t want to do this because this could be weaponized against you,” they go, “Oh, please.” They just never learn. Even if you feel like it’s already being weaponized against you, things can get worse. I promise you, things can get much, much worse. Always think about that. Always think about whether this is really something that won’t have massive counter-reactions against you in the future. Essentially, I feel that in the marketplace of ideas, if there aren’t restraints on us, we kill these guys every time. Every time. And part of that is that to win this fight — particularly during a crisis — you have to be at your most rational and stick to your principles the most. That’s very important, because these things are going to age a certain way. I saw I’m not alone in this — Nick Fuentes was also catching flak from his audience for the same reason as me, because we both said there’s no evidence to suggest that Israel killed Charlie Kirk. And the way the lowbrow conspiratorial mind works, everyone went, “Ah, Nick got the call too. Dave got the call, Nick got the call.” Whatever. None of these things prove either side is right or wrong. But if you would say me and Nick Fuentes are two of the most prominent critics of Israel in the country, and we’re both telling you there’s no evidence here, and your reaction is, “That’s proof they both got the phone call,” isn’t it more likely the opposite? I’m not saying that alone proves anything, but isn’t it more likely there’s just not enough evidence here? Part of what people are missing is this: if you just jump on a theory with no evidence to back it up, how does that look when the dust settles? Do you think about that at all? Number one, I just wouldn’t want to do it because I think it’s wrong. But on top of that, how’s it going to age? We’re all constantly building our track record — in our personal life, in our public life. You want to think about that too. There will be a time in the next decade when right wingers want free speech. You want that on your side. You are better off having a track record of being consistent and principled in that realm. Otherwise you’ll never reach people who care about reason and principle. And that’s what I’m all about. Those are the people I want to reach. That’s something people should keep in mind. It doesn’t help anything, especially when they’re already dying. And as I’ve said before, I think essentially what happened here was the market. Jimmy Kimmel just—look, let’s put it this way: there was a much bigger cancellation attempt on Joe Rogan than on Jimmy Kimmel. It was much more organized, much more central, with celebrities like Neil Young saying he’d take all his music off Spotify and all this other stuff. But Joe Rogan didn’t get cancelled, because Joe Rogan’s numbers were massive. And Jimmy Kimmel didn’t have any of that protection, so he got—so in some ways I think this was the market. But the FCC threatening the [__] out of him and then essentially taking credit for it afterward kind of robs you of that victory. It’s as if the ref started threatening one team and then after the game started bragging about how they really cheated and won that game. What’s that doing for the side that won? That’s not helping you. That’s robbing you of your victory. So I don’t think it’s as simple as some people are making it out to be — like, “Well, Jimmy Kimmel’s just a guy, just a comedian telling a joke, and people shouldn’t get fired over telling a joke.” No, there’s a little bit more to it than that. He consciously made a decision to join the regime and be a spokesman for the regime. Like, you go into a war zone and pick up a rifle, you are a combatant now. It doesn’t matter if you’re officially a member of that military or not. You pick up a rifle and start marching toward an opposing army, you’re fair game now. In the same sense, you made yourself part of the regime. I don’t care about this on a moral free speech issue level. I don’t. This is the realm of strategy now. And in the realm of strategy, I think this is all wrong. I think right wingers are much better off if they just publicly say, “We don’t want the government involved in this at all, but we’re all turning off Jimmy Kimmel.” Which, the thing is, you guys already have. I just saw a report on the numbers. The numbers were so bad, dude. This podcast is doing better than Jimmy Kimmel’s show was. And believe me, I do not have a contract like Jimmy Kimmel. He was already losing. Just something to think about. Something for all you guys to play with. All right, thanks for tuning in. Catch you guys on Monday. Peace.

    "transcript":"David Spade: Dandelion (2025) [cheers and applause] Nice. Denver, good to see you. Thanks for coming. Yeah. Love Denver, haven’t been here for a while. Quickly, does the altitude affect your peeing? Because last night, I could pee so far off my bed. More than normal. Local bits. All right, anyway, um… I think a lot of you drove here. I drive a lot in L.A. It kind of sucks. Obviously, I have a little bit of road rage, but… I will tell you one thing. If I’m driving and I let you, I give you the gift of merging in front of me, you better wave. [cheers and applause] Yeah. There will be problems. I’m like a psycho because I think of it as, like, a bigger favor than most people, so if I look over and I’m, like, “Go!” If I give you that, I want to see this… I want to see at least this in the window. I’ll take this.I’ll even take the cigarette– deesh-deesh– with an ash.I’ll take scraps. You can’t do nothing. You can’t do nothing. If you do nothing, I will follow you for a minimum 100 miles. I will go to your house, I’ll put an air tag on your bumper at midnight. Other than that, I’m pretty chill, but… Sorry. By the way, just quickly, off the record, um, in 1998 they invented the cordless mic. Now let me just– Listen. Now, listen, Paramount Theatre, let’s not jump on trends. I don’t mind dragging 42 feet of fucking cable around that weighs 16 pounds. It’s throwing out my clavicle, and we’re on joke four, all right? Jesus Christ, let’s not hop on fads. They have a sweetheart deal with fucking RadioShack at the mall. No, actually this is Amazon, okay, so this is… This is Jeff Bezos getting a fifth private jet, and then he gets my dog shit mic off a fucking Black Friday deal. Amazon Prime, whatever they call it. Yeah. [cheers and applause] On the only night that matters. Great. Stick your hand in there. Goddamn. I love that Amazon gets it from Amazon. That’s… All right, well… Oh, shit. Flew out here, um… The pilot when I get on says, “Hey, welcome to our 737. We just got our door back.” Now… why are you mentioning the door that flew off because I don’t know if it’s the real plane? Don’t talk about it, I just forgot about it. Do you remember when the door flew off the plane? You remember how terrifying that was? Then they showed a video of it. I go, “Oh, my God, they have a video?” This must be pandemonium. No, no, no, if you saw it, it was dead silence. People, like this… Like it was, like, some M. Night Shamalama-ding-dong movie. I’m, like, “Guys, the door is off, it’s night time, even scarier, tornado-like winds,” and they’re, like… Wh– If it was me, just the noise of my diarrhea hitting everyone’s forehead on the way out.Deesh-deesh-deesh.I’d be wailing on that call button.A-bung-bung-bung-bung- bung-bung-bung-bung.[whispering] “Hey, um, was there a door when I got on? I don’t even check anymore. It’s kind of a given, um…” And then the people in the way back, they go “We didn’t know what was going on.” What do you think’s going on?Dude, I’d be popping up like Meerkat Manor. What do you think, it’s the blower’s broken? Pssst!“Goddamn, that’s strong.”Shunk! “There goes my chain!”Shunk! “There’s my baby! Turn this off. Fix it!” When I get on, they give me the Pepsi scam too. No offense, dog-shit Pepsi, but you know what, when I get on there, I always go, “I want a Diet Coke.” It happens everywhere. This is like a weird phenomenon. I was at a casino gig. I’m in the restaurant and I go, “Hey, um, Diet Coke.” They go, “Nah, we only got Pepsi.” I go, “Well, I saw a store walking in here, maybe I’ll just go grab one.” He goes, “No, we’re a Pepsi casino.” “Wait, all effing, fucking 40 acres of this place, that’s all, all Pepsi? I don’t know if this is legal.” And he goes, “But you know what?” He helps me out. “There’s a 7-Eleven a couple clicks down the freeway.” And I go, “Mm. Are you going? I’m not going, are you going? Wh– A couple of clicks, am I Vietcong? What am I–? What are you talking about? Is that an inch? A mile? How long’s a click?” “You think I’m walking down the freeway in the middle of the night?” No, thank you. So, I’m on the plane, and then I order a Diet Coke, and they go– They don’t even bother telling you they don’t have it, they go, “Mm-kay.” “Let me get that for you. Let me get your Diet Coke.” And they go back to that little apartment. [makes sound of curtain closing] And then they come out, “Here’s your Diet.” Vague “Diet,” vague. And then they go hide behind that little fucking bulkhead or whatever it’s called. And I’m like this… [sniffs] I can tell already. And they go… [wicked cackle] “Ah, you caught me! It’s dog shit, sorry.” No. God forbid you ask for anything. It’s usually just, you know, some ratty hose water. I’m, like, “Can I get some water?” Like, “Yeah.” Then she brings a big, nice fat bottle, and I go, “Ah.” And she goes, “No, no, no.” [soft laughter] Here’s your little, filthy little Dixie cup that you wash your mouth out with at the dentist. “Can I take that?'” “Uh, I’m not done yet.”Crunch. There you go.Then she comes by later with a gerbil feeder, I’m like this… [makes sucking sounds] And right before we land, she’s got the iron. Dooff, dooff.I’m, like… [makes sucking sounds] It’s fucking steam, dude, I’m not gonna walk you through all of them. All right, so… I watch the movies. Delta has the worst– Well, whoever, no names, but they have the worst movies. I’m looking through this, it’s crummy movie, crummy movie. It’s like, “How about our new arrivals.” Thank you.Hey, Delta, I don’t think we can count FernGully as a new arrival.27 Dresses?Don’t make me Google it. Yeah. 2004. So I settled on The Beekeeper and, um, The Beekeeper’s fine.I know what I’m getting, Jason Statham at his medium-est. Uh, because he’s the same in everything, but he’s good, but it’s always the same, you know, he’s got a scowl, lot on his mind, few words.But the problem with The Beekeeper is that it’s–Just writing-wise, ’cause I’m a writer… [clears throat] …so I look at movies through a different lens. Different prism, if you will. And it’s a little itchy because he’s a beekeeper,buzz buzz, you know, the whole thing with the hat on.And the reason he’s doing this because he escaped the FBI where he was an assassin nicknamed “the beekeeper.” Folks, can he be any other profess– I mean… don’t make it so easy to track him. We’re trying to make sure we get him in the first act. They’re like, “Hey, that guy’s a beekee–” You know, it can’t be that easy. Go work at Foot Locker, you know what I mean…? So, they do catch him, shockingly, within like four minutes, and then quickly kill everyone he knows. Then… he gets mad, takes the thing off, and he goes… [British accent] “I’m the Beekeeper.” “I keep the bees, and if I find you, you might get stung.” And I’m like, “That’s a bee. Okay. This is the problem. You’re a bee or you’re a beekeeper. I didn’t like that.” And then he goes, “And if I sting you, you die.” “That’s a bee again. And the bee dies. The guy doesn’t die, the bee dies.” I was like, “I gotta get out there. It’s too much, it’s already off.” Anyway, let’s hit the headlines. What’s going on with this Johnny Depp trial? Some of these are old. I think he’s gonna do it. I think he’s gonna win it. That Amber Heard’s pretty. That’s her problem, too pretty. You know what they say, “Crazy in the head, poops in the bed.” Huh, who’s with me? This guy? You’ve said it. That should be her merch. What is she waiting for? [chuckling] That submarine, though, that went to the Titanic.No! Listen! I miss that crazy little sub. I got attached, guys. Two weeks. No, but the reason I’m bringing it up is because they’re doing it again. Some other dipshit billionaire is like,“Let’s go to the Titanic in a microscopic dangerous sub.”It didn’t work! What does he need to know? I’ve got some data. You don’t go in an eight– This is the problem with billionaires. They want to go to the bottom of the ocean or Mars. You know what, I’m rich, I find things to do on the surface of the planet. I run around, I go to Cheesecake Factory. I find shit to do here. Fuck. These guys… Who wants to go to the magma level of the earth? What a drag. And you’re in that eight-foot sub where they jam eight billionaires down. You have to sit cross-legged like you’re on Southwest. No, thanks. I wouldn’t do a TikTok in that thing. Lock it from the outside? Even if you do happen to bring a Crescent wrench, you’re like, “Oh, wait it’s…”Boop. [makes static sound] Boop.You’re going down, and then on Instagram they go, “Do you know how deep it is?” I go, “It’s pretty far.” “No, no, here, we’ll show you. Here’s a chart. Here’s the ocean. Here’s how big you are in the ocean. It’s farther than that. Here’s the Statue of Liberty. Farther. Here’s 10 Godzillas. Farther. Here’s where sharks get a headache.” “All right, I got it. I got it.” A picture of a shark like this… They got a one-foot window with moss on it. What’s the allure? By the way, imploding. Not the way to go. I mean, it might be ’cause it’s quick, but sad. I don’t want my last five seconds on life to be like… “Do you guys hear a pop–” Pfft. You know. Fuck it. [chuckling] I don’t like that joke. I don’t like it. [chuckling] Oh, and Mars. Fuck, Mars is no good. I got bad news for these billionaires. Mars is a bigger shithole than the moon. There’s nothing going on. It’s just farther. Do you want to go farther? I would only go ’cause I like aliens.I got hooked on E.T. as a kid.You’re too young, but the E.T. movie was fun.A little scrubby alien.By the way, when I was 8, I wasn’t even that enchanted by E.T.,I don’t know why. First of all, ’cause he looked like a piece of dried-out beef jerky. I’m supposed to fall in love with this thing? Even Spielberg in those early meetings should have been like… “This burnt fucking road kill, this is our guy?” I was thinking of, like, a Tickle Me Elmo. This guy’s literally made of crow’s feet, his whole body. It’s impossible.” And he’s like… [makes croaking sound] He’s so dry. And I get when you fly, it dries you out. I get it. I fly to Arizona, it’s one hour, I’m dry, I get it. This kid’s like… [makes grunting sound] I mean… Steps out of that spaceship, let’s roll him round in some Nivea. That’s the first order of business. Spackle some coconut oil in those cracks, dude. Just so I can have a conversation. And he’s like… [in croaky voice] “Well…” It wasn’t that enchanting to me. And then Gertie. Kind of an idiot, but she’s 5, you know. What does she know? She’s like, “Oh, my God, E.T., let’s go in and I’ll make you some potatoes.” You don’t touch the monster from space. Covered in space COVID with omnicrons. You know what you do, Gertie? If you’re helping us out, you take a rake and you poke him a little bit, you know? You get the reaction time. What’s going on with this guy? What’s his temperament? Knock him down, don’t pick him up. You hook his feet, and you drag him in the barn. Not the living room, the barn. Now we run some tests. Anyway… I got distracted. What happened was– You were talking about the ocean. So, in the ocean… Somebody was. And in the ocean… I like the ocean, but I was scared of it as of late ’cause when I was a kid, I loved it. But they had riptides, I was like, “I don’t wanna go in.” So now when I go in, even when I snorkel, I get a little water in the thing, and I go, “Pull me up, pull me up!” And they go, “All right, well, you’re standing up, okay. You’re okay. You’re in three feet of water, you’re just going to lift your head like that, and then…” Water’s gone. And I’m like, “Ah! It was touch-and-go there for a while. It was real touch-and-go.” [old salt voice] The sea, she was angry! [normal voice] “No, yeah, well, you’re also in the pool, but I understand. It is scary.”E.T.– Oh, Brokeback Mountain.You know they’re making, um… You know– I’m just thinking movies ’cause I’ve got my ear to the tracks ’cause I’m in Hollywood.There’s a rumor they’re making a Brokeback Mountain reboot.But this one is with all women, which, honestly, I don’t think is a great idea because the first one, the whole feel was it was dangerous ’cause it was two dudes. You know, it was very taboo. And then they said it might be Emma Watson and Margot Robbie, and I was like, “Well…” …as long as it’s artsy, you know what I mean, like… Who am I to get in the way of cinema? Just keep it real, let’s pepper in some scissoring, let’s have some fun, let’s do it right, you know what I mean?” [makes mechanical sounds] [mechanical sounds continue]Beep, beep, beep.[makes whirring sounds] [makes friction sounds] I don’t know how it works. That’s how I picture. I don’t know if there’s that many noises. [chuckles] Little WD-40 in there. [makes squirting sound] [chuckles] Ey-oh. Boy. Watching late-night TV. Stupid. Three in the morning, I’m watching Lifetime or something. There’s a show there, you know, about the overweight actressthat moves to Hollywood, My 130-lb Life. There’s one about a doggy doctor. Everyone loves dogs. There’s a doggy doctor open all night. And everyone’s so dramatic when they run in. It’s like, “Oh, my God, my dog’s a Leo acting like a Capricorn.” They’re like, “Oh, come on. Come on, how long’s this been happening? What moon is it?” I have a dog, does stupid things. Super adorable, super cute. Doesn’t show enough emotion. Shows happiness, sad. Never embarrassed. Only does embarrassing things, never embarr– You know, walks through a glass door, it’s like, “What’s going on over here?” I’m like, “No, no, no. No, no, no.” You don’t go, “Oh, ai-ai.” You know. Looking at me like, “Did you see that?” No, no, no. I walk in, eating a turd, it’s like this. [smacks lips] I’m like, “Are you eating a turd?” It’s like… “Yep. Mm. Mm.” Like it’s from Erewhon. I’m like… The dog fell so hard the other night that I was like, “I can’t believe–” ‘Cause I was watching TV. I’m like, “What could have happened?” For 30 seconds, I wished my dog could talk. Just walk me through it, he’d be like “Oh, my God, I get to talk, here we go. Quickly, uh, all right, uh, you were in watching TV, right? I was in the way, way back of the house. I thought you called my name, I’m not too sure, I have a bit of the zoomies, to be honest. So, I start going full blast. I’m like, ‘Yeah, I’m running.’ I got all four paws, yes! And I’m like, ‘I’m fast as fuck.’ Boy, I’m like, I’m into it, right, ears are back. And I’m like, ‘Yes, yes,’ and I’m coming down, I see the piano, I go, ‘Oh, no, I have to turn.’ Now, I did not plan this at all. I did not plan it, right? So, I start going, ‘I better stop.’ Now, here I come. I’m putting the brakes on, it’s not working at all. ‘Cause you know, I’m like this. I’m on the hardwood floor, so it’s slippery. My nails are too long– your fault. So… I start going. Now ’cause I’m built like a kettlebell, my butt’s huge, I start spinning. Now I’m spinning. Now I’m going fast and I’m spinning. I’m like hydroplaning, if that’s a word. So now I’m going backwards, I’m like, ‘Hey, fuck it, Jesus take the wheel, I don’t know what’s happening.'” “I spun– I took that piano leg out like a bowling pin. Piano fell on me, chandelier fell somehow. Glasses, pictures, it was a shit show. Oh, my God, and I popped up, I’m like, ‘Hey, what’s on TV in here, what’s going on?What is that, CHiPs?'” [cheers and applause] Yes. Why’d I tell you that story? I don’t know why. Um… I’ll tell you another one. Oh, this is home of the Denver Broncos, did you know that? [cheers and applause] Move it. Now, uh, the last football game I really got into was the Taylor Swift Super Bowl. And if you saw that… Something interesting about a super famous person going, and being so famous that all I’m doing is watching her watch the game. That was kind of a phenomenon. And, you know, 18 cameras on her, three on the game. It was so weird to me. And poor Taylor’s in some box trying to relax, but she can’t, because we watch a five-hour game, and we can just sort of drift off. But she’s gotta be like, first down, second down, third down, fourth down. You know. God forbid she gets up to get a chalupa, you know? She’s like, “Hey, what’s going on back here? This quesadilla’s cold, and these stuffed veggie– Fumble! Oh, fuck, was that my guy? Was that my guy? Was he wearing red, did you see? What happened?” And they’re like, “Oh, my God, they broke up.” You know, that’s… “She doesn’t care anymore.” That’s what she deals with. And then on the reverse, like, it was typical boyfriend-girlfriend because after that he wanted to… [whistles] … to Vegas and go to a bachelor party. And she said, “Oh, I thought maybe you could buzz down to Australia and see my show.” And he goes, “Oh, okay.” He doesn’t know where Australia is. You know? [chuckling] And so then, he goes, “Hey, babe, I just checked on Travelocity. That’s like 80 hours if you go through Houston.” She’s like, “Yeah.” He’s like, “Oh, uh… so, what, are you doing some new stuff, or…?” “No.” “Same five-hour show I’ve seen 30 times? Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.” No, it’s shall I…” And she’s like, “Grab a jet, just fly down.” He’s like, “Right, there’s 16 paychecks. Okay, I’ll do that.” And then when he gets there, it’s the reverse. Now we’re watching him watch her. And he also has to add in the dances, he’s like… And they’re like, “That’s right, dude. And there’s 200 more songs.” And he’s like, “Holy shit, this is like the Combine.” When I go to Journey, I only got to know three. I’m sore from that. Fuck. I’m breathing. Just got a little sore. Ah. Got into a scrape at McDonald’s. Got into a little rumble. Wrong place for me. I’m a bit of a dandelion, guys. I don’t know if you can tell. I look tough on TV, but it is not the case. These quads are deceiving.I roll into McDonald’s ’cause I’m a thousand percent Joe Dirt.I still go all the time to McDonald’s. But sometimes I drive through. So, I’m driving through. This is two weeks ago in Hollywood. I’m driving through– Thanks, Bezos. I’m just– Fucking shit. They said, “At the end, can you roll it up in a circle? If you can! Can you roll it up real tight? If you can’t, it doesn’t matter, doesn’t matter at all. We have a hundred crew guys. Doesn’t matter. It would help.” So, I go to McDonald’s, and I’m like third in line. And then I see, as per Hollywood, a crazy person comes out of the bushes, no shirt, drenched in sweat, super weird, carrying a T-shirt, and I’m like this, “Hmm.”Walks over to the guy ordering. Ech! Starts snapping people in the face,in the windshield, the guy taking orders. Whap, whap, I’m like this…“Ah, shit, okay, let’s put that in reverse.” Beep, bee–Everyone, we’re all going back, you know? So, I get back to here, then I go… “I’m just gonna park.” You know, I don’t want to leave. I want to watch. So… I don’t want to get hit, but I don’t want to miss the fun. So, I say, “Well, this’ll be cool.” So, I go in, I get a six-piece McNug, I come back, and I just sit by the window, and I go, “Oh, here we go.” Before I even open it, I look up, and he takes a five. I’m like, “Oh, no, no, no.” So, he starts walking right at me, I’m like, I can’t even think, I’m like, “Don’t come–” Now, he’s looked down, I’m like invisible. Because I couldn’t move, and I’m like, “Do not know me.” And so, door opens, I see feet. And then– And then he goes, “Little help?” And I go, “Yep.” I go, “There’s 10.” Doesn’t leave, of course. And then he goes, “Give me your McNuggets.” And I go, “No.” Denver, I’m such a colossal pussy, you don’t understand. What am I doing? You know what, I sometimes just get sick of it, but is this where I want to die, is this where I die, on this hill? I go, “I’ll give you one.” Because you know, I did puss out a little bit. You know, ’cause you know what, he had a cinder block, did I tell you that? Cinder block. And he doesn’t even mention it. He’s like this. I go… He should say, “Hey, this is my lucky cinder block.” Like something, like “Don’t be afraid.” But he’s like this… And I’m like, “I do not react well to getting hit by a cinder block. I have brittle bones, no matter where you hit me it’s gonna be a problem, I’m telling you.” Even the dust on it I wouldn’t like, make me itchy. So I go, this– All this means I’m giving him one. I summarize the situation. And I go, “I’ll give you one.” And then he doesn’t really say anything, so I go… and I sound rude, I wish I had some fucking tongs. I was like, eh… ‘Cause he took his super-drenched, wet, sweaty hand, he went… [makes squelching sound] It was like the ShamWow, like, [makes squelching sound] and I was like… “There you go, buddy.” And then, he doesn’t even care, he, like, puts it in his pocket, and then… Then he goes, “Give me another one.” I’m like… But he doesn’t know that I only eat four out of six. So, I haven’t lost yet, guy’s a push, right? But I do hem and haw a bit, I go, “Uh…” I grouse. Then I give the second one. Of course, it’s not over, he goes, “Give me the rest.” Now, it’s decision time, do we fight…? And I go– And before I totally puff up, I go… Oh, I have a brainstorm, I go, “Hey, I gave to you 10, why don’t you go buy some?” And he goes… Something was creaking and making sense in his head, he goes… And then I dart my eyes to the two guys working there and they go, “Fuck, no, don’t do it…” And I go, “They’re waiting for you, now scoot!”He turned a quarter inch, and I went ecchhand dove in my car and started crying. But you know what? Stood up to a bully, Denver. Yeah, I stood up to a bully, applaud that. [chuckles] Terrifying. Almost shit my– Oh, speaking of, I got a colonoscopy. Down, ladies. Quick story, 22 minutes, I got a, uh… Call the sitters. I got a colonoscopy, which you have to now and then, and… [single clap] [chuckles] So I, um… Firstly, to start it you have to take a bunch of stuff to cleanse the system. Clean out– You know what I’m talking about? You know what I mean, when you cleanse the system? Let’s look at a clip. Did we bring the clip? We don’t have the screen? So, you know what it is. Then they lay me on the slab, the gurney. Then the doctor takes a breathing tube this big down my tiny throat. It hurt so much after, I go, “Hey, you didn’t happen to jam your wang down there, did you?” And he goes, “You can’t prove that.” I go… So they put me on the gurney and then they go, “Here’s the Propofol.” Knock me out. I didn’t wake up fast enough. Everyone says they love that part. I didn’t. I was like… [makes gurgling sound] So, he’s trying to explain the procedure. I don’t listen, so he leaves a file on me. So, I wake up, I’m like, “Oh.” It’s like, four pages of scribbling, and then five huge photographs. I’m sorry, who are these for? You have five mongo pictures of my butthole. What am I– I’ll take a few wallet-size. What do I need these for, the fridge? Am I handing these out at parties? I go, “Hey.” The guy goes, “I wanted to show my work.” I go, “I trust you. I don’t know what you did, I don’t care.” I don’t care if you did it. And– ‘Cause, you know, they get in there, and so… they rough you up. ‘Cause I was so out of it, I go, “I think I fell off the table.” I was so sore, and I go to the guy, “Hey, did I fall off the table?” And he goes, “Did you what? No.” And I go, “Well, my leg has a bruise right here, and my clavicle’s broken.” He goes, “I think it was like that.” And I go… “No, it wasn’t like that when I came in.” “And my ankle’s twisted. How many times did I fall, roughly?” Because they rough you up. Like, I saw a thing on liposuction on YouTube, and they just… I picture, lift your skin, skinny little vacuum, and they go… [makes soft sucking sound] “Here we go.” No, no, it’s rip the skin up, boombox, crank it. “Hey, it’s Margie’s birthday, we’re all going to Bennigan’s after.” [makes whirring sound] The guy’s like this… I’m like, “Holy shit, goddamn! Somebody do something.” No wonder everyone’s covered in bruises. So, I wake up and I leave. After they did a whole number, you know. And the next day my buddy goes, “Uh, you walking funny?” I go, “No, why?” He goes, “Does your b-hole hurt a lot?” I go, “No, why?” And he goes, “Didn’t you just get a colonoscopy yesterday?” I go, “Oh, my God, I don’t feel anything.” He goes, “Weird.” I go, “I don’t like it.” Because I got scared. What if I got abducted by aliens? This probably won’t happen, but what if I got abducted by aliens? They could run a train on me, I wouldn’t even know anything. I wouldn’t know. I come back to earth, I’m a hero, everyone’s talking, “What happened?” I go, “I went in this room, and we were just talking about some stuff, and um, about, like, my knowledge of Earth.” And they’re like, “Dude, we found a thousand alien babies in your butt.” I’m like, “What? Wait, what? Mine? Oh, my God, there must have been some shenanigans going on up there. Ai-ai-ai!” Um, anyway, so here’s why I’m a great guy. I gave to charity about four years ago. Thank you. And– No, I did go to a charity for Haiti. Now, in Hollywood, they have these big shenanigans where, like, Haiti had an earthquake. Sean Penn… [inhales] …goes over there, gets on a canoe, floats around, and… surmises the sitch. You know he does that. He comes back, and he goes, “All right, we’re gonna raise some money and do something right.” Great. So, he gets about 300 showbiz types, we’re in a room. And we all spend money. The idea is to auction off stuff. Great. And the things they auction off are very expensive. Win a hot air balloon ride with Justin Bieber, you know. Take a rocket to Mars with Elon Musk and three friends. So… But it’s all expensive, so selfishly I’m like, “I’ll go. I’ll have a few knocks and maybe bid, maybe not. I just want to go, really.” So, I go there, I sit at a table with like, Charlize, all these stars. Now I’m a little– a little wasted, you know what I mean? I’ve had a couple, and I don’t realize it. Because I’m nervous. And then Charlize is there, I look through the pamphlet, I go, “Ooh, I might bid on some stuff. Ooh, Paul McCartney tickets and a meet-and-greet.” And I’m like, “That sounds good.” But it said it might go up to 10 grand. I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t love that.” So, I go, maybe I’ll bid for a little bit and then… [whistles] jump out. So I go, “All right.” So, I get my ping-pong paddle, and I go, “Hey, Charlize, you better buckle up,it might get a little ching-ching-chingy in here.”And she goes, “Are you talking?” I go, “Nope. Nothing, I don’t know what’s going on.” “What am I doing?” I’m talking like this, “Don’t be drunk.” I’m drunk. You know, you try not to be drunk, I went… [makes swishing sound] And then I got my ping-pong paddle like this… And Sean’s like, “Coming up next…” I’m already in over my head, I don’t know what I’m doing, and he goes, “Paul McCartney tickets, two tickets and backstage.” And I go like this… And he goes, “Start the bidding at 50 grand, David Spade,” and I go… “What’d he say? What’d he say? No, he did, did he say five? No, he didn’t. Five-0? What do you mean? No, no. Hey, Sean.” This is a hundred percent true story. “Sean, I think you said 50, but ideally what happens in these– You do increments, like, you say one, and then I say two. And then you say three, and there’s an increment, and I don’t know if I say four, I don’t know. But I think you, like, jumped high.'” It’s dead silent, I’m like this, I go… And Charlize is, like, “Are you broke?” I go, “No, no, no, no, I’m not– I’m just saying. It’s funny, like, 50,000’s like a penny to me, I’m just saying it’s a funny scenario of humongous it is, the money. It’s just funny.” Now I’m like this. [exhales] But now I’m like, “What am I doing, I’m already in over my head.” I start sweating. [sniffs] But here I am, and Sean– It was like a dream. He goes, “60 over here, 70, Spade, 80.” I go, “80, me?” “Spade again.” “Oh, uh, 80,000 for still two tickets? Holy– Talk about Ticketmaster. I mean, Jesus Christ, we got some fucking fees in there.” “But no, really $80,000, that’s what we’re seriously saying? We’re saying 80, 80 for–” Silent again. I see DiCaprio craning his head going, “Who invited this?” I’m like, “I’m doing it. 80,000, it’s the cause.” So now, I can’t even hide anymore, I’m like this. [exhales] And within one second, he goes, “Ninety! Spade a hundred.” I go, “It can’t be a fucking hundred! It was one second ago. It cannot be a hundred grand. Guys, I shouldn’t be here.” I started to crack. “Guys, I don’t know what I’m doing here, I came for fun. Honestly, I shouldn’t be here. I swear to God, gun to my head, I couldn’t find Haiti on a map. I don’t know what’s going on. Is it still by Hawaii? I don’t know. But honestly, was it a bad earthquake? I mean, was it a rumbler? It’s not a hundred grand. I’ve been in them, they’re scary. It’s not a hundred grand, I’m telling you. Guys, wha– Let’s think about this. I mean, it’s a hundred grand, and give me my phone, I have to text someoneand find out if we’re doing Grown Ups 3. Just give me one second.I need some money.” [panting] [cheers and applause] So in over my head. So drunk. Shitting, freaking out. And then they’re all looking, and I go, “I’m doing it, I’m doing a hundred, I’m just saying it’s a really good cause and lets, let’s do this.” And I’m just like, “Goddamn,” and then he goes, “Anybody, 125?” And I go to my table, “You guys, do not connect eyes with Sean Penn, he’s a bad person. Just let him– Let Jeff Bezos sweep this one and get the fuck out of here because he should do it and be a hero, and then I’ll get out of here, all right? So don’t look at him. Everyone look down and be real quiet, and this will all go away.” And then he pulls the biggest rat-fuck of all, he goes, “Spade, 125.” I go… “‘What are you doing? I don’t understand. Why would he say that? I– I’m the hundred guy. I said a hundred, remember? I think I won. I don’t know, I won? Do I win ’cause I said the highest or am I…” And then he goes… [inhales] “Spade, Spade.” I go, “No, no, no. No, no, no.” Oh, my God, it was like a bomb went off. Look at DiCaprio in slow motion. “Spade. Spade.” The whole goddamn place, “Spade, Spade.” I go, “125, guys. I fixed Haiti, it’s fixed. I did it.” Thank you! Spadey saves Haiti. [cheers and applause] I walk out of there like a bum. Ahh… People are talking, I can’t even hear them, like… The sickest part is it took a week to tell my accountant anything. I go, “Hey, good news, I got a big write-off.” I sound like Kramer, I go… He goes, uh, “What happened, what do you mean?” I go, “I bought stuff at an auction. And then I buy stuff, I get these tickets, and I pay a little more and then, um, and then I write it off, it’s free.” He’s like, “Well, the way that works is you can write off the face value of the tickets, which is $300, so how much more of that did you spend?” It was more. You’ll find out. [giggles] Anyway, um… Christmas is coming up or it just happened depending on when this airs, and, um… I don’t get Christmas cards anymore, sadly. I get a lot of, um, lazy emails. You know what I mean? Christmas card email, and I only got one. It was Happy Holidays from your family at Toyota of North Hollywood. Where you got an oil change six years ago. And we still have your email. My family never knows what to get me for Christmas ’cause I’m like the spoiled Meghan Markle of the family. They all sort of glare at me and grouse, but… Just ’cause I’ve got a few beans in my jeans, they all like, “I don’t have to get you anything.” I don’t need anything, I’m fine. I got my flannel shirt for Denver. I’m, like, “Hey, Denver.” Look at me, blending in. So, my brother, who’s older, is a tough guy. Works construction. He always gets me something, and I have to appreciate it, but it’s always just something random. So, he goes– He comes over and he goes, “Hey, man, I got you this.” And I go, “Oh.” It’s a knife, it’s a buck knife, like 11-inch Bowie knife that’s used, it’s not wrapped. Guys never give anything wrapped. Just like, ehh. Then he goes… And it’s got dried blood on it, so I go, “Oh, my God, thank you,” first of all. And then I go, “A knife, huh?” Then he goes, “I know you like knifes.” I go, “I do?” He goes, “Well, at dinner, you’re always like, ‘Can I have a knife?'” I go… That’s fair, yeah, okay. I’ll take it. I go, “That’s great, uh…” I go, “Is it dried blood?” And he goes, “That’s a funny story.” I go, “Yeah, continue.” He goes, “Well, at my apartments there was a big gang fight, you know. And the cops were there, and it was crazy. So, I went out there to rattle off a few TikToks. And so, they’re all looking for something, I looked down by my foot, and there’s this knife. So, I step on it, I kind of scrape it to the curb ’cause you know what I’m thinking.” I go, “Christmas?” [sighs] Right. He goes, “Anyway, I don’t have the thing it came in.” I go, “Oh, the body? That’s fine.” “I don’t need it. Oh, the Ziploc evidence bag? I don’t need it.” And then I’m at the airport talking to the guys at TSA and laughing, and two cops literally pull me back, and they go, “Is this your bag?”I go, “Why?” And they go… Sching!I go, “Oh, my God.” They go, “Is this yours?” I go, “Yes and no. It’s actually– It’s a funny story, um… It’s not that funny, I don’t know, I don’t know what to say. Yeah, I don’t know…” They go, “You can’t take this on the plane.” I go, “Yeah, no shit.” I go, “Just throw it away.” And they go, they’re willing to look the other way, and I go, “Yeah.” I go, “By the way, thank you for putting your fingerprints on it too. Thank you.” Now this case will be thrown out. It’s getting hard to watch porn on an airplane. [clears throat] It’s not impossible. I watch porn on a laptop. I want the whole THX Dolby. So, when I’m watching it, I don’t– first of all, I watch it in the aisle, and I get looky-loos behind me, I don’t like that. [audience laughing] “More brightness!” Get out of here, come on. But porn has sort of jumped ahead. I got out of it for a while, I got out. For a while. I’m back in. But… [laughing] …it was, like, you know, sort of just basic when I had the VHS. They were just naked, I was happy, you know. Now there’s 500 categories. I don’t get it. I looked– These categories, guys. First one, mother-daughter porn. I’m like… This got okayed by everyone? Just everyone in the meeting was, like… Oh… I like it. By the way, just so you know, it’s not a real mother-daughter. I mean, you know, in a perfect world, but… Too bad. Honestly, it’s– What they do is they take the, uh, young 19-year-old ingenue and they team her up with a grizzled vet. [laughing] And the grizzled vet doesn’t like the other one, and you can tell, it’s very clear. After two minutes, she’s like, “Beat it, junior, I got this.” “Let me show you how it’s done.” [makes suggestive sounds] “Not bad for 76, huh?” Everyone goes, “Seventy-six, wha–?” The porn guy’s like, “Hey, can we–? Can we get a union guy–? Who’s 76? What’s a– What’s a cougar again, what’s going on?” [roars softly] There’s also stepbrother-stepsister. That one, fine. You know, fine. I watch it. About 10 minutes before any action. Ten minutes of yapping. Why on God’s green earth are you talking so much? Why are you ad-libbing? Why, just… And she’s like the whole time, like, “I’m so naked and hot, but you’re my stepbrother.” He’s like, “I know, stepsister. I’m so horny for you, we should have sex, but I’m your stepbrother.” I’m like, “I know, go! I know, that’s why I’m here. Wha– I clicked it, I’m all caught up.” “Go, go, go, wh– What’s happening?” She keeps yapping, “My uncle’s your dad.” I’m like… “Is he? What, what? I don’t… I’m doing math, just get it on.” Be a real sis– I don’t care. You think I’m closing my laptop. No. I’m in this one. Oh, there’s squirters, I don’t know. Guys, squirting, stay innocent. I didn’t know what it was. I’m innocent. Because when I grew up, there were no squirters. Now there’s too many. What happened? You pick it up along the way? Is it a YouTube tutorial, like… My friend– I didn’t know, he goes, “Check this one out.” I go, “What is it?” He goes, “You’ll see.” I go, “Why is that guy’s hair all wet?” He goes, “Just keep watching.” And then I’m like, “Wait, what’s squirt–?” He’s– Not to be graphic, the guy’s head is down in her nether regions, right? And she is squirting, and it’s crazy ’cause he’s in there like, getting nailed, it’s like… [barking sounds] …it’s like a dog biting at sprinklers, like… [makes barking sounds] I’m like, “God dang it.” Running through frame. [makes chomping sounds] I’m like, “Is this good or bad? I don’t know what’s going on.” I’m not– This is new, and I don’t love it. God forbid some girl squirts with me, I wouldn’t know what to do. I’m the unsexiest. I come in, like, ‘What’s going on in here?” You know, like, ready to get it on,and then, deesh. “Oh, my God is that–Is that window open? Did you see that?” “Oh! Did someone step on your stomach? That came from your way.” “Ha! Wait, are you doing that on purpose? No! Don’t aim it at me, don’t! Listen, don’t do– Oh! Got me, ah… Come on, oh, this cashmere. Oh, my God.” “This isn’t coming out.” Then I have to humiliatingly go to the dry cleaner. “Can you get this out?” “What is it?” “Nobody knows.” Yeah. Figure it out, we’ll go on TikTok. And show the world. Yeah! [cheers and applause] Oh, boy. By the way, when I was a kid, I was, uh… I don’t want to say cute ’cause it’s not strong enough of a word. It was more adorable. Um, I almost got kidnapped. This is– I’ll make it funny. It was– I’m so… It came out weird. I almost got plucked from a mall… Well, first of all, I was 8 years old, blonde hair,looked like exactly Macaulay Culkin, early Home Alone one.Like, I was nailing it. And I was kind of tan, I was, like, shorts, I mean, it was almost entrapment. Honestly. Who’s turning this– If you’re a child molester, I’m your dude, right, so… Anyway, I go– My mom takes me to the mall. And it wasn’t the helicopter mom days. I think you remember. She’s like, “See you in eight hours.” You know, so… No one blinked, there’s no mothers going, “Oh!” They’re like, “Yeah, my kid too.” So… Here’s a quarter in case everything goes sideways on you. So, I don’t know, about five hours later, she comes back to the mall, and she’s in a card store. I’m buzzing around. I go in this card store randomly, and this old guy, like, 50– which is not old now. Back– Back then. In this scenario, I was 8. Now it’s, like 25. So, he’s this creepy 50-year-old, and he goes, “Hey, kid, do you want to go in my van and get a snow cone with me?” And I’m like… “Yes.” Like, obviously. Obviously yes, it was like, “Did I win the lottery?” There was no weird feelings, no gut feeling, no tingles, no nothing. I was just, like, all aboard, you know? But then I go like this, “Could it be ice cream?” And he waits. And I go, “Either one. Ice cream, ice cream sandwich. I don’t care, whatever.” I’m like, “Am I blowing this deal alre– What am I doing?” And he was either smart or stupid because he paused. I go, “Could it be ice cream?” And he goes, “Uh… Yeah, okay.” Dude, just say yes. What are– We’re not getting ice cream, we’re not getting any, I’ll be chained to a radiator in an hour. Just– Why would you stall? You blew it because in that moment, my mom sees me and goes, “Hey!” And I go, “Hey, there’s my mom. I gonna grab my coat, and I’ll be right back.” And I run up, and he goes, “No, no, no!” My mom, I go, “Hey, I’m gonna grab an ice cream with this dude, and I’ll be back.” And she’s like, “No, no, no, you’re not.” And I go, “Hey, dude, Mom says no go.” [chuckles] And he goes, “What the fu– We had a deal!” And I’m like, “Nah, no good.” Meanwhile, I shrug it off, he’s like, “Nahh!” His own– It’s his own fault. Oh, he’s kicking himself. Oh, I did a movie once where, uh, I had to use squibs. You know what those are? Lingo. Like, I had to get shot in this kind of serious movie. So, I’m in my trailer eating a burrito. I don’t care about it, you know, ’cause I’m gonna have to strip down. But I thought it was the next day.So, deesh, deesh, this guy, older special effects guy,long gray hair like this in a ponytail. He’s like, “Hey, man, we’ve got that squib shot today. Can I squib you up?” I’m like, “Oh, is that right now? Is that right now after lunch? Oh.” He goes, “They’re ready for you.” I go, “Oh.” So, he takes these you know, like, pellets that are filled with fake blood, and then they have to put them on like an EKG, and then they have a wire.And then he goes… keesh… and he pops them off like a little thing.And it stings, you know. So I go, “All right.” So, then I have to strip down to my boxers, and then he’s like, “All right, I’m gonna stick these on you. Okay. Where are your pecs?” I’m like… “Just guesstimate where they are.” “Okay. Pop one on the old jellyroll over here. I’m gonna put one on the old muffin top. All right. I think that’s enough, we got ’em all on.” And then he goes– Okay, now, you have to put your shirt on really delicately. And then your pants go over the wires so they’re sticking out the bottom, and then you tuck them in, and then everything’s like connected. So, he goes, “Walk very slowly to the set.” You know, it’s about a hundred feet. So, I start walking, and he– It’s out of my pant leg into the little plunger. And so, he has to walk three feet behind me, he goes, “Go slow,” and I go, “All right.” Literally I pick up my script, I forget he’s there after three seconds I go… [imitates flatulence] Three farts in a row. And I hear behind me… “Hey, come on, man.” I go, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I forgot you were there. I forgot you were there in one second.” I was like, “Oh, no, oh, no.” And… and I start sort of squeaking out farts ’cause I’m laughing. And then I thought, “Oh, my God, I have to kill this guy because I can’t have him out there knowing this.” Because the worst part was, he wanted to hit me with a brick, but because he’s a crew and he’s professional, and I’m in the movie, the worst thing he can say is, “Hey, come on, man.” Not even yelling it. And I was– I felt so horrifying that I did this, I was like… And you could tell, he’s like– Wants to kill me. And then we go all the way to the set, and then, uh… And then later, I know he’s gonna work on a movie, and he’s gonna have his grandkids around, they’re going to go, “I heard you were with Leonardo DiCaprio–” He goes, “David Spade almost shit on me. That’s the story you’re gonna hear.” Staying in a nice hotel. Not this one here, this one’s shitty, but two days ago, No, um… Also, I got a massage. And the thing is, I don’t– I don’t like to get a massage from dudes, and it’s nothing bad, it’s just I don’t want to ask for a female, I want a female, not ’cause I’m a super-creep, it’s just better because I want to be, like, the strong one. And then– Which isn’t even always the case, but… Guys understand, if you’re a guy, you know, you don’t want another guy rubbing you, right? It’s kind of weird. So, I don’t ask for a female, and this is my problem. So, I’m there, and I call down, and they make it so easy. “Hi.” I go, “I’d like a massage.” They go, “Oh, great. Um, okay, well, you want male or female?” I go, “I don’t care.” [scattered laughter] I care so much. I just want them to decide for me. Do the right way, go the right way. And she goes, “Oh, we don’t care either, so it could be literally, we’ve got a female right here, we have a male, whatever you want.” I go, “You pick.” All right, we’ll send Rick. Now I don’t even want a massage. Now I’m standing there meekly in my little dainty robe. And this dude walks in, “Hey, man, what’s going on?” I’m like, “Hey, man. Blow it up.” And he’s huge, got mongo hands. Big, long finger, for some reason. So– So I go, “Just regular massage, man. Just reg.” I don’t throw any code words in. You know what I mean? Swedish. No, don’t say that. You don’t know what it means. So you go, “Just regular.” He goes, “All right, man, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.” And I go, “Yeah, and maybe just 20 minutes. We don’t need to do the whole hour, just kind of…” And he goes, “Cool. Let’s get you face down.” I go, “No, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. Relax, don’t talk like that, like don’t say–” What am I like this? I’m not doing that. I’m not doing that. Face down. I know what I mean when I say that. Don’t say that. I will go to the table toughly, and then I will get in the prone position. And he’s like, “Yeah, whatever, that’s what I said. Okay.” Get up and I get down, then I got the little circle faceplate like this. So, I get in there, but don’t go to sleep. Eyes open. Eyes open. What’s going on, you know? Pay attention. So, not relaxing at all. So, he goes like this… “Let’s start with those calves.” I go, “Don’t talk, just go.” [makes grinding noises] Something like this. Then I’m like, “All right, move it along. Move it along, guy.” Like, how much time do I need on my calves? I don’t even know if I have any muscles in my calves, you know what I mean? I’m not Flo-Jo going to do the hurdles tomorrow, I’m just like… So, he goes, “Let’s get those hamstrings.” Don’t whisper. Don’t whisper. Just do it. So, he goes… [grunts] Big hands. [grunts] Noise. [grunts] And I’m like this. [grunts] Like, moving me all over the table like a rag doll. And then he bumps me ball bag three times.Boof-boo-boo. I’m like…My balls, he hits them, do you get what’s going on? Ram! He goes– He’s going too high. “You’re too high, back off. You’re going higher, you’re going higher.” Ball bag, ball bag. I’m like this… And then… wha… “By the way, it’s not my leg anymore. I don’t know what you’re thinking. It’s not my leg anymore, you know that. You know bodies. Back off.” “What is it?” “I don’t know, it’s not my leg.” “So, what are you still doing up there, you know what I mean?” And in fairness, I’m thinking, “Well, when I lay down, I don’t really know where my balls are, you know, or my dick. I know they’re in the room with me somewhere, I just don’t know where exactly ’cause I’m kind of rolling around. They could be over here, you know?” But no, I know they’re over here because he’s bashing them, ramming them with his hammer hand, and covering them with fingerprints and bruises because he’s bashing the shit out of them for 35 minutes. And then I go, “Back up!” It’s like a Roomba. “Back up, you hit something, back up.” Nope. Ram, ram, ram. Smash, smash. And I finally, after a hundred, I go, ah, ah! Too much, too much. Tingles, tingles. Feels weird, it’s weird, it’s a weird feeling. And I jump off and he goes, “Oh, wait, sir, are you gay?” I go… “Am I?” It was the awkwardest stalemate, we’re like… We both don’t know which guy’s gay, you know? We’re both like– Spider-Man, like… So I just stood there like this… Awkward, weird. And then he goes, “I think I’m gonna take off.” I go, “Okay, yeah.” So, he takes off. Now it’s just me. Little Spader, I’m just standing there awkwardly in the dark… covered in oil… fully naked with a boner. Hey, maybe it was me! You guys, thank you for coming down to see me. I love it. And bye-bye.

    "transcript":"Doug Stanhope: No Refunds (2007)Director:Milton LageWriter:Doug StanhopeStar:Doug Stanhope Not all stand-up comedy is spot-cleaned and pre-packaged for the masses. Like the legends who were born out of smokey, booze-soaked nightclubs of decades past, Doug Stanhope spews his own brand of moral outrage in an unmatched style that borders on self-destruction. Nothing is sacred, no subject off-limits and most importantly nothing is contrived. From critically acclaimed appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to regular appearances onThe Howard Stern Show, Stanhope always shows an intelligence and brutal honesty in his comedy, no matter how viciously graphic or unsettling the material may be. Taped live at the Gotham Comedy Club, this appearance is an unflinching look at one of the few voices left standing in the dark, punk-rock underbelly of stand-up comedy. Doug Stanhope: No Refunds (2007) | Transcript DOUG STANHOPE: New York is baffling in that it’s a city that prides itself on being an absolute shithole. I say, there’s nothing good here and people are proud of that. They’re happy. (feigned laughter) Oh, it’s overpriced and it’s overpopulated. And it stinks like piss, and comics, comics film specials here. And they all open with a joke about, “Yeah, I spend $8,000 a month for nine square feet.” And you go, “Why don’t you f*cking leave here? Why do people stay here?” But, unfortunately, this is where comedy works, where people are the most miserable. I’d rather be filming a special on a beach in Costa Rica at a tiki bar right now, but they don’t need comedians. They’re already smiling. They’re already happy, naturally. So that’s why I’m doing this special here, ’cause it’s the last f*cking place I want to be. I’m going to be smoking through this whole set. (cheering and applause) Because that’s… that’s one of the loopholes in the, uh, law. They keep the… in the smoking bans, they keep… “if it’s part of a theatrical production,” a loophole in the law, ’cause they don’t want to f*ck up some fa*gy Tennessee Williams production and ruin the integrity of the show. So they leave this f*cking loophole open for me. If-if the cigarette bothers you because you’re envious, vote next time. How about that? Vote. Yeah, every now and then figure out what the f*ck’s going on in your community. I know you don’t vote, you got shit to do. Leave it to old people with breathing problems who will never come here. This whole f*cking generation is so unbelievably sad. If you’re just getting to, like, partying age, you’re f*cked. There’s nothing going on in this country anymore. It’s done. Last call. It’s just a suck generation. It’s the most boring, f*cking generation in the history of people. It’s all dumbed down and wadded. When’s the last time you heard stories about rock and roll bands chucking TVs out of hotel windows or any of that shit that, that used to be… fun? Like, there was fun in the world. I-I-I… some of this is going to make me sound like a grumpy old f*ck, and I am, but I have, I have just cause. This… there’s nothing… As people get older, the older you get, the more bitchy you get, and you-you, (grumbles) ’cause that’s just natural. The more you’ve done shit, the more jaded you get. But I think we’re going to be the first generation of old people… as soon as someone gets old, they complain about the new kids. “Oh, these kids today, look, they’re crazy.” It’s always that the new… It used to be always that the new generation was too deviant, these kids are out of control. They’re crazy, they’re immoral. Look at what they’re doing. “In our day, if we wanted fun, we just went to a barn dance, and we didn’t even finger f*ck till we were, like, 35 years old. But these kids today.” It was always that the new generation was over the top, and we’re going to be the first generation of elderly people complaining, but in the opposite fashion. Where we’re going, “Look at these “kids today, these half-fa*gots. We used to do crank off of titty dancers and shit. No one got hurt, we had a lot of fun. We got some good stories and herpes out of the deal. It was a f*cking good time. The blisters bring me back.” These pussies, they drink a Red Bull for some pep. And they’d prefer if you went on the patio for a cigarette. The closest they come to a fistfight is on a message board somewhere. “You looking at my girl? I’m going to delete you from my MySpace friends. You got some ‘block user’ in your future, fa*got.” They’re about to start piss testing for adrenaline in the workplace. That’s how sad this country’s gotten. Shaking your urine in front of you. “Is that yours, Donnie? It looks a little cloudy. Have you been having “fun on the weekend? Are we not enough fun for you “here at the Verizon Wireless family? You need to seek it elsewhere? I don’t think you’re a team player.” That’s why I love hearing people go, “Oh, that town, that’s like 20 years behind the times, that f*cking place.” Book me there. I had fun 20 years ago. What, I can still smoke indoors? Ecstasy is still pure, uncut and readily available? Oh, shit, what cavemen they must be. The only drugs that are even popular anymore are all the… dummy drugs, all the drugs that make you more boring. All the mood stabilizer, antidepressant… Everyone’s got some mental disorder they’ve been diagnosed with, and they take a f*cking pill. They push them on me all the time. I’ve ruined so many relationships, ’cause, you know, ’cause I think. I f*cking think all the time, sorry. “Oh, jeez, oh, you, you… It’s ADD.” No, it’s not ADD, I’m thinking. I’m thinking about a lot of stuff. That’s not ADD. Yeah, I stutter a lot and I f*ck stuff up, but I’m… That’s ’cause I’m always thinking. “Well, you’re not listening to me.” ‘Cause I’m thinking about something that’s more interesting than you! I’m trying to build a perfect Utopian society in my head, and what are you talking to me about? Bowling or what? And I do, I have a head that won’t shut the f*ck up. That’s where the ideas come from. Do you have a head like that? Do you have the brain that just won’t shut the f*ck up all the time? You learn to work with it. Did you ever try to do this? I tried this in July in Tucson, Arizona, and, uh, failed miserably. Did you ever try to sleep sober? You ever try to do that? It’s completely impossible! I tried. I’ve got a meeting at 6:30 in the morning. I’ve got a flight to L.A. for a meeting so I’m trying to be responsible. And I’m just laying there in the hotel. There’s no people or conversations; no distractions. Sober and no television, just your head on a pillow. 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., mother… ‘Cause that’s when the carnival kicks into high gear. (singing carnival music) “You’re almost 40 years old, you f*cking loser. How long you going to do this? How long you just going “to get drunk and amuse shitheads for a living? Well, there must be something that rhymes with orange. Lorenge, smorange, porange…” This f*cking music is playing in there, and it always sucks. ♪ We didn’t start the fire. ♪ “Shut the f*ck up! I’ve got to go to bed! Three more hours, I’ve got to sleep!” My ex-wife is in there. “You never took me to the Botanical Garden. It was always about you, you f*cking megalomaniac. You never cared. I was dying of loneliness.” ♪ It was always burning since the world was turning. ♪ “Shut the f*ck up! I’ve got to sleep.” I’m not taking f*cking medication for it. That’s also where the ideas come from. I’ll just pour some alcohol on that when it happens and try to even it out. You work with your problems. F*cking everyone’s taking pills just ’cause they’re afraid of standing out or… “I was terrified when my doctor told me that I had a unique and interesting personality trait. But then he told me about new Zoloft or Prozac. And I just take three pills a day, “and I blend into this f*cking horrible, inbred, corporate landscape, and I don’t care.” They’ll legalize any drug, so long as that drug keeps you producing. That’s all they give a shit about, is production. You kicking out enough boxes at the plant, well, go, whatever keeps you doing that. Keeps you vaguely content sitting in a cubicle. Go ahead, FDA-approved. “I have a job where I alphabetize insurance forms 45 hours a week, and I noticed I couldn’t concentrate so well on my job. So my doctor put me on Adderall, and now I can just breeze through my workday. I don’t even notice that my empty life is being pissed away underneath fluorescent tubes. I have no highs or lows. I have no good stories. I’m just… But I’m getting a lot of stuff done. I’m probably the most boring person I know, “but look at me produce. I just go ABCDEFG, HIJKLMNOP.” You don’t f*cking take a pill for that. You’re not concentrating ’cause that’s f*cking boring, and that’s a natural reaction. It’s boring. Don’t concentrate. Find another way. You got to make a living. You got bills to pay? Buy less shit and find some fun. Suck a dick. You gotta pay bills, suck a dick. I’m talking to you in particular, ’cause you’re close. Whatever. Spin around a brass pole a few times, whatever. Say you saw the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich and sell that shit on eBay. There’s a grift in the system. There’s always a scam. You don’t have to do it just ’cause your guidance counselor told you you’d excel at it. F*ck ’em over. This country is so bereft of imagination anymore. So f*cking… those pills, probably have a lot to do with it. “I was a real slut when I was a younger girl. I slept with a lot of guys. And it’s not something that I’m proud of. But I’m in therapy now, and my therapist put me on Wellbutrin and Effexor. And she explained to me through our sessions, the reason I was so promiscuous. I come from a military family. So I didn’t have a stable male role model in my life. I have a low self-esteem, ’cause I’m a little bit chunky. And I try to compensate for that by having sex with a lot of different men.” Maybe you just like the cock! Is that possible? Is that possible that’s why you slept around? You like a f*cking purple meat hammer whaling in and out of your f*cking untrimmed, winter-ready New York sludge pot? And that’s fantastic. Take some cock. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s free fun, that’s what it’s there for. Jeez, don’t take a pill. Take the cock. It’s, it’s there for that. Maybe your clitoris is there for a reason. Huh-huh. Clit’s there to attract a f*cking pork sausage. It’s one equal right you’ll never get. You’ll have every equal right in the world, and you’ll… Women—not you specifically—get over yourself. I’m talking, women will never have the same equal right as men do to just… You can’t sling pussy without shame attached. You’ll be, you’ll be Hillary Clintons, and you’ll get equal pay, but you want to go f*ck like this guy f*cks on a weekend? He gets high fives, you get “Whore!” They have to keep some shame involved. I won’t pick on you just because you’re in the front. That doesn’t matter. But I’m making a point. And-and I know it sounds base or coarse, but… the reason that you can’t do that as women… pussy really is the main motivating factor in all of humankind. It really is. It’s what gets shit built. I’m not, I’m not, “Yeah for pussy.” I’m not, I’m not… This is a flaw in the system. Don’t clap for it. I’m saying, that’s the… they know that is a catalyst, and that’s why religion and government have to control supply and demand of pussy. And they do that by heaping shame upon you should you want to give away more than the federally allocated recommended daily allowance of pussy. “Oh, she wants to suck more than one dick? Whore! Shun your natural instinct, whore. Or nothing will get built.” Uh, but they-they know that. It’s, it comes down to production. It really does. They have to keep that-that pussy like a dangling carrot, something that’s hard to get, so he keeps running on the treadmill, building out more shit, sending out more boxes to the Dollar Store, pointless shit that no one needs. That’s why cocaine is illegal. It makes pussy too easy to get. They can’t have it. They cannot have it. If pussy were suddenly easy to get, if it were simple for human beings to just relate on a regular level… If he could just lay down a big fat rail on the first date, and you gack it up, ten minutes later you’re sucking his dick in a dirty urinal. (moans) You’re loving every second of it… (moans) …no inhibition. If it were that easy, then you wouldn’t have to spend 60 hours working in a factory and saving up your overtime check so one day you can afford a spoiler for your Honda that’s gonna… attract a girl’s attention. And then after a lengthy courting process and you meet the parents and sign the contract, maybe then, one year on your birthday, she’ll suck your dick in a broom closet. (groans) “I feel like a whore.” Should have done the bump. It’s f*cking awful. It’s… Just got to make sure you produce. Buy, buy shit you don’t need. Come on, diamonds and f*cking flowers. At least black people knew when they were slaves. You remain clueless. Oh, saving up. F*cking get a lot of work done. Hard work, hard work is fine if it’s a work of passion, but just to work hard to buy shit to impress people, you’re a f*cking loser. F*cking empty vessel. Hard work, if it’s, if it’s hard work that you do for free, hard work, if it’s a work of passion, you’re, you know, working at learning how to play the acoustic guitar. You’re trying to find my prostate when we’re on Ecstasy or something. That’s a work of passion. Sure, go. Dig in, root around, you know? Just to work hard, it’s awful. “You worked hard to get where you are.” No, I didn’t. I drank, smoked and did drugs to get where I’m at. And really, I’m not glorifying shit. I ain’t trying to build it up, but it really is responsible for where I am. I haven’t ever tried very hard. I’m here ’cause, I… you know, drugs expanded my imagination and made me think outside of, what, your f*cking reality. And cigarettes gave me the patience to sit and write those thoughts down in a comedy-friendly format that you could understand. And alcohol gives me the courage to stand up here in front of you judgmental pricks and do it with a quarter million dollars worth of cameras in your face. I didn’t f*cking work hard for this show. I-I-I am ill-prepared. There are, there are people here from the first show that, uh, and, you know, “Wow, that’s a lot of different material.” Yeah, just ‘membered. (chuckles) Right? I don’t, I didn’t want to try hard for this show, ’cause I didn’t want to send the wrong message to the kids who might be watching at home. Don’t f*cking work hard. Dummy, you die at the end! Didn’t anyone tell you? Sorry. That’s the alcohol. But it makes me funnier. That’s why, that’s why I’m drinking. I-Ironically, I’m drinking to be more professional. ‘Cause I’m funnier when I’m drunk. I really am. 17 years. I have AA friends that I’ve had for… lifelong friends that all of them have had to eventually cave in and admit that I’m funnier when I’m drunk. It f*cking kills them! It’s like they have to deny their own religion to admit it. They’re like, “All right, all right, you’re f*cking… That was a good show. I know you’re f*cking ripped, but, Doug, you have a serious problem, and you make jokes about it, that’s how you deal with it, but I’ve been in the program for a long time. If you ever want someone to talk to… But don’t quit tonight though; we have tickets for the late show. But… We’ve seen you sober. It’s a stuttering, awkward wreck with no self confidence. But tomorrow, if you’d like to, uh, talk to me, I’m up at 6:00 a.m.” It’s f*cking horrifying, have an AA guy tell you to your face. He’s supposed to be the know-it-all, and he tells you that your career is dependent on your disease? Kind of a scary proposition. It’s like having your psychiatrist tell you that not only are the voices in your head real, but they’re accurate as well. What? So I should kill the babysitter? “I’m afraid so.” Hey, I’m pouring more funny down my head. Pipe down. Jesus died for your sins. I’m doing it for your mere entertainment dollar, ladies and… That’s far more admirable. Jesus never made you laugh. Never once. You never worked all week, f*cking stacking pants at the Banana Republic or whatever you do, and rushed home on Friday night and dressed up to rummage through the Bible to see what crazy antics your slapstick savior was up to this week. He never made you laugh. He was a mythical, boring, unfunny f*ck, and I love you more. Now watch me jack off. That’s not even a regular tagline. Kind of detracts from the whole purpose of this joke, but the… Why would you… I don’t even understand the connection; die for your sins. What does, how, you… He died for your sins. Well, how does one affect the other? I f*cking, I hit myself in the foot with a shovel for your mortgage. What? I don’t… I don’t understand the… And if there is a correlation, why would you do that? Why would you die for someone’s sins? Your-your sins are the only interesting thing about you dreary, bleak motherf*ckers. Your sins are what make, make you fantastic. That’s what keeps us great and exciting and fun. That’s what makes you alive, man. You should wear your sins on your sleeve. You should be trying to top your sins on a daily basis. When you go to work in the morning, the first thing out of your mouth tomorrow morning at work should be the dirtiest shit you did tonight, ’cause that’s what people want to hear. It makes you, huh! Right? You tell me a story, hypothetically, you tell me a story about what a good Christian kid you are and how that good book has filled you with some effervescent loving light of Jesus that shines out of every pore in your squash. You’re walking on sunshine ’cause of the Lord. At the same time you keep the story going real loud at the same time, you tell me a story about that one time you kick-f*cked a girl with cerebral palsy, and we’ll see who draws a crowd. Even, even your make-believe, slapstick Jesus on a stick would have to walk away from you right now. “Oh, that’s very. That’s very nice. I pray for you, too, but I-I really want to hear this. (yells) Start over! You did what? Was she into it? Oh, my God! What, uh, what kind of industrial lubricant do you… I can’t believe I died for these stories. These stories are fascinating.” (chuckles) It’s so f*cking silly. If you’re Christian, you get cheesed off with the Jesus. I got Jew-hating stuff to follow it, so… I mean, you are a shithead, but I can make you feel like you’re not the only shithead. ‘Cause I got a f*cking big blistering chunk of Jew-hating coming right your way right now. I didn’t… I-I wrote this, uh, bunch of Jew-hating stuff. I didn’t intend to. I was over in Scotland for… Every year in August in Edinburgh, Scotland, they have the Fringe Festival. It’s the biggest arts festival in the world. It’s a whole month long. And I’m there in August and, uh, some jackass writer for this, uh,London Times, he’s trying to, he’s writing a story about anti-Semitism at the Fringe. And they had found a review of mine from earlier in the festival, this anti-Semitic guy, and-and where I had been quoted out of context, like, oh, just a string of blurbs. “He says shocking things like blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah.” And one of the things I had said that he quoted was, “I hate the Jews.” Which sounds anti-Semitic. So all of a sudden, I get thrown into his little piece of literature, and I had said it, I had said it, yeah, without question, but I had said it in, like, a happy, fun-loving, Jew-hating way. There’s no animosity. It wasn’t even a bit of mine. It was just some aside when I was rambling about… F*cking Mel Gibson was in the news at that time. And I’m rambling about him being called anti-Semitic, going, “Why’s he getting so much press? “He’s an actor. Who gives a f*ck what he thinks? I need press. I hate the Jews. Give me press.” And ironically, yeah, bam, bam, bam, banging on the door. It’s a f*cking funny story. If you know me, if you guys have known me for a while… I’ve been doing this 17 years, and I… I could fill three CDs worth of just the Christian-bashing alone I’ve done over my career. I’ve done Mormon-bashing and Muslim-bashing. I’ll do… I’ll do more Scientology-bashing once I have a stronger legal team, but… (laughter and applause) But it wasn’t… it wasn’t until this phone call, that I realized I’ve never done any Jew-bashing in my whole career. All the religion-bashing I’ve done, I’ve never f*cked with the Jews. I was like, “What… How did they ever escape?” Uh… And they do. They…. You know, in religion-bashing, Jews never get f*cked with, because A: they don’t have the aggressive recruiting policies that other religions do. They don’t have billboards every 30 feet, “Be a Jew or burn in hell. Jew God is watching you.” They’re not banging on your f*cking door with pamphlets. “I want to talk to you about Judaism.” So they don’t get shit for that. They don’t get shit because they have that Holocaust sympathy they can surf on for another 15 years till the last survivor dies, or till the History Channel goes out of business, but… And the Jews, to their credit, they don’t have the history of atrocities that other religions have. They don’t, ’cause they f*cking lost all the time, sorry. But they don’t, yeah. They’re not like, you know, the Muslims and Catholics. I’ve heard so many comics doing bits about this new pope. “Oh, isn’t it scary, this new pope used to be a Nazi?” And you go, “Not when you look at their track records side by side.” The Nazis versus the Catholic Church? The Nazis only lasted a dozen years, and they got their ass handed to them in a high hat. Catholic Church has been… Has a far more prosperous and prestigious record of murder and torture and tyranny and oppression. (cheering and applause) And nonsense. Not to mention the kid-f*cking. And they’re still around and more popular than ever. I’d be far more afraid to hear someone go, “You know that new Nazi? He used to be a pope.” “No shit? I’m f*cking out of here. That guy’s dangerous.” So, f*ck the Jews. That’s what I’m saying, I guess. F*ck the Jews. I’m sorry. I never said it over the course of my career, but f*ck the Jews, just for being a religion at all. You’re as complicit as the rest in the retardation of human intellectual progress. And f*ck you, too. (cheering and applause) F*ck you. My brother’s a Jew. My brother’s a Jew, and I f*cking… F*ck him, too. I hate his guts for it. It’s not like on a hate-hate level, but f*ck it, what are you thinking? He converted ’cause the only humorless cunt in his life that would ever f*ck him twice-he had to cave in and marry her. ‘Cause he’s afraid to die alone, but he… but he doesn’t mind settling for less. And now they’re together in… in a passionless swamp of a relationship, and… And they teach their kids that shit. See, the parents wouldn’t have him if he wasn’t converted to Judaism ’cause they’re racist. And there’s another reason to f*ck the Jews. I don’t like racists. F*ck you, too, Jew. “You’re not good enough if you’re not a Jew.” F*ck you. Mostly I hate the Jews ’cause they’re wicked annoying. Can we agree on that? Really, they’re wicked annoying. Listen, of all the religions I’ve been around, the Jews have a tendency to throw their Judaism into whatever conversation you’re having, any topic, whatever the subject. “Whoa, that’s funny ’cause I’m a Jew.” “Oh… Oh, I’m a typical Jewish mother.” “Did I say I grew up Jewish?” “Well, my Jew family…” “And Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew. ♪ Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew. ♪” “That’s all I got to say.” Jew, Jew. Why-Why… Why do you keep saying Jew? Why do you keep saying Jew? I’m at an airport bar with you. I have to talk to you, but can you stop reminding me that you’re irrational in every third sentence? It’s like… It’s like people who are really into their astrological sign, and they have to pitch that into whatever conversation you’re having to define themselves. “That’s funny. I’m a Virgo.” “Here’s my Virgo coming out again.” “You’re going to have to excuse me. I’m a bit of a perfectionist. It’s ’cause I’m a Virgo.” No, it’s ’cause you’re a douchebag, and you’ve been busting my balls all day. (laughter, applause, cheering, and whistling) It has nothing to do with your astrological sign or some alignment of the stars. It’s ’cause you’re a shithead, and it’s time for you to take individual responsibility for who you are. Don’t act like if your parents had f*cked a month earlier, you’d be feeding me chili dogs and letting shit slide. You’re an asshole. Be who you are, but… “I’m a Jew. We naturally carry a lot of guilt. It’s a Jewish thing.” No, it’s a you thing! You, that f*ckhead in that chair! Has nothing to do with Judaism. If you have guilt, maybe you’re weak of character, maybe you’re f*cking guilty of something, I don’t know. Maybe you just stole that bottle of Jaeger out of my freezer, and you’re trying to… But it has nothing to do with some ancient tribe of blah, blah, blah. That’s not attached to your DNA, right? By the… By the… By the same logic, we all come from apes, but I don’t throw ape in every conversation. Use ape to define myself, use ape as an excuse to defecate in my thumbless mitt and then hurl it at you. “Yeah. I’m sorry. Did I just splatter you with wet feces? I’m sorry. I have a very rich ape upbringing, a strong ape heritage. I…” (groaning and laughter) ♪ Because I’m an ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape ♪ ♪ Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape ♪ I’m really worthless as an individual. Anybody… Anybody who defines themselves solely on their… their race or their religion or their nationality… if that’s the first thing out of your mouth… “Well, what are you all about?” If that’s the first thing on your MySpace page… “Well, I’m an Irish-American, blah, blah…” What the f*ck is that? Who…? You got nothing else. Community college and something else, but you use that f*cking trivia ’cause you got nothing to say. MAN: Go get ’em, Doug. I’m kind of out of shit. Not in this set. I mean, I have some stuff I put on paper, but in the long term, I think I’m out of shit. F*cking cannibalizing my own… 17 years, what else do you have to say? If I die soon, don’t ever say I died too young. Every time an artist dies young… I got, like, nine more days before I’m 40. If I still have that three in front of my number, maybe they’ll say I died young. If I have the four, died early perhaps. Died not as late as he could have. But every time an artist dies young, Kurt Cobain or whatever, it’s always the people… “It’s so sad. He had so much more to give.” How do you know? Maybe he was out of shit. (laughter, cheering, and applause) How do you know? Maybe he’s done. He got all the money. He did all the drugs. He f*cked all your holes, and that’s the American dream. And when you’re done with that, you go, “Oh, that’s why they call it a dream. It’s bullshit. I’m still empty.” And he cashed out. Maybe? How do you know what any artist had left? How do you know if Jimi Hendrix hadn’t have died, he wouldn’t have wound up doing Super Bowl half-time duets with Elton John right now? ♪ Rocket man ♪ Wah, wah, wah, wah… And you’re going, “This is tragic. Why didn’t that guy die? He was my hero. I don’t want to see this. It’s f*cking pathetic.” How do you know if Lenny Bruce hadn’t have died, he wouldn’t have wound up taking over Andy Rooney’s spot at the end of60 Minutes? Just some crusty old cunt with wiry eyebrows bitching about ATM fees and a cluttered desk. What do you know? Maybe he was out of shit. But back tonationalism. Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to… hate people that you never met, and… all of a sudden, you take pride in accomplishments you had no part in whatsoever. And you brag about, you know… Like, the Americans go, “F*ck the French. F*ck the French. If we hadn’t saved their ass in two World Wars, they’d be speaking German right now.” We go, “Oh, was that us? That was us? Was that me and you, Tommy? We saved the French? Jesus! I know I blacked out a little bit after that fourth shot of Jagermeister last night, but I don’t… I don’t remember.” (laughter and applause) “I know we went through the Wendy’s drive-thru. We were going to get one of them freschetta sandwiches “that look so alluring on the commercial. But then we ordered it, and realized we had no money, and we had to ditch out before the second window. And those douchebags in line behind us “with the bass music probably got our order, and… We laughed about that, but I don’t remember saving the French at all. I-I went through the last ten calls on my cell phone, and there’s nothing incoming or outgoing to the French looking for muscle on a project. I checked my pants, and there’s no mud stains on the knees from where we were garroting Krauts in the trenches at Verdun. I think we didn’t do anything but watch sports bloopers while we got hammered. I think we should shut the f*ck up.” (cheering and applause) It’s silly. All that stuff. Tradition and heritage, it’s dead people’s baggage. Quit carrying it. Did you make it up? No, it’s passed on to me. Pass it back. Every immigration argument that you hear, they never come from a… well, how does it affect you personally? “Well, you know, these immigrants, they come to our country, they burden our tax system. What they do is, they come here “and they get into our education system and our health care, and I gotta pay the taxes. My taxes have to pay that.” Well, what the f*ck are you doing to me? Every time you have a kid, every time you have a kid, ’cause it’s American, I should pull up a chaise lounge and wave a flag while 15 of those things come out of you. Pay every… oh, I can’t wait to pay for these, they’re American. I have a vasectomy and an abortion on my record, but I can’t wait for all your f*cking fatheaded Midwestern kids to come out of you. What are you, Catholic? Come on, be fruitful and multiply. Love it. Love it! I’ll get a second job. No, keep… “Well, these immigrants, they don’t, f*ck… they don’t speak the language.” Then don’t talk to them. There, I solved your problem. That was quick. You know who speaks the language perfectly? Your next-door neighbor. You’ve lived there eight and a half years, you’ve never said one f*cking word to that guy. You avert eye contact should you check the mail at the same time. So why would you give a shit what the guy selling gnit-gnobs in a cart in the park speaks? It’s none of your f*cking business. And all the, all the clichéd arguments, like that, well, they’re, they’re lazy, they’re shiftless, and they’re criminals. And all this, they… all those arguments go go against the main clichéd argument of they’re taking American jobs. I live on the Mexican border. I live seven miles off the Mexican border in a town, Bisbee, Arizona, a little town. I can go out any day and watch Border Patrol arresting these guys by the dozen, 11 at a time out of a Dodge Omni, like a clown car with plastic cuffs. And you’re right, they don’t speak the language and they probably have no education. They don’t have f*cking shoes half the time. They’re like barefoot and tattered castaway, like Gilligan’s Island shorts and… “Hey!” In a f*cking dirty T-shirt and they’re dehydrated wandering the desert for four days. (moaning) And if that guy is as qualified for your job as you are, you’re a f*cking loser of such epic, humiliating proportions. I would be ashamed to have anyone find out that guy took my job. He doesn’t speak English. What, do they do your job training in pantomime, shithead? “Oh, si, come in. Boink, boink. I see. Boink, boink. Crank, crank, crank, crank? Crank, crank, crank, crank. Oh, dadadadada.” You’re outta here, mullet-head. That guy’s more qualified. F*cking asshole, you should have tried harder. Nobody bitches about immigrants taking their job if that person has skills of any level. Goddamn f*cking brain surgeons sitting around the Beverly Hills Hotel lounge. “You know what really chaps my ass, Barry? Scandinavian fellas are coming over taking all our good neurosurgery positions, the Norwegians, specifically. I say we down ourselves a bottle of Jack Daniels and go stomp us some Weegie ass, the first Weegie we see. We jump…” “jump… jump out of that Explorer and pound him. F*cking immigrants.” All started with that Einstein. Once they brought him over from Germany and we didn’t have any good genius jobs, it was a trickledown effect. Stealing your job. Hate, hate, hate. Fear, fear, fear. Hate, hate, hate. Fear! Come on, they’re taking your jobs, and terrorists are trying to blow up your Ford Focus specifically. You need some f*cking… Where’s my Purell? I touched a doorknob. There’s a new fever, a flu. There’s a big fa*got, sober, responsible, boring, dull, hand-sanitizing generation, and I can’t get the germs off me fast enough. I’m afraid. F*cking fag. Fa*gots. I… I try to qualify. I use “fa*got” too liberally, but I use it as a word of weakness. I attach no sexuality to the word, and if you’re gay and you’re in here and you’re offended, I’ll be at the door on the way out and I’ll suck your dick just to show that I meant no offense. I’m not going to get wicked into it and like yank on your balls, like, like you’re coked up and that’s the only way you can come. I’ll just pinch you with two fingers and (grunting)… But just to show that I mean no disrespect, ’cause it’s too strong of a word to let go. “Fa*got” is a good word. So you know, I got a little sore on my lip right there, to match the one that broke out on my dick from distress and… Yeah, yeah, well, you know what? I mean, I-I, I was a player, not a f*cking spectator in this life, honey. You look at herpes like a skateboarder looks at a skinned knee when you play long enough. Ain’t that big a f*cking deal, and I ain’t that into you anymore. I’m an old man. I don’t give a shit. Anyway, let’s move on. I was trying to segue into kid-f*cking, but, segue is gone, let’s just jump right in, shall we? Yeah. Oh, they’re very popular, all over the television, the f*cking… Catch a Predator, MySpace, you know, f*ck, yeah. Like, I don’t know, ’cause I… I was a kid at one point. I don’t remember, but there’s pictures. But, uh, I remember we didn’t have the Internet, but to avoid predators, our parents would go, uh, “Hey, uh, son, don’t talk to strangers. Some of them might try to f*ck you.” And you go, “Oh, thanks, man. Thanks. Thanks for that heads-up.” And then you just went about your day. Does that not work for the Internet now? You don’t have to parent anymore? Oh, the Internet, like they have some crazy way of getting around the “don’t talk to strangers.” What the f*ck? If you’re parents and you’re in here I know you don’t want to hear this. You’ll argue with me and you’ll say that I-I’m twisting the facts, I’m wrong, but this is the truth. That, that probably, and huge probability, when I say “probably,” astronomical odds, Vegas odds, statistical probability, probably, nobody wants to f*ck your kid. I know you don’t want to hear it. You want to think that child is so ultra-f*ckable, that all the pedophiles there, they’re jockeying for position right now down at the seesaws waiting for him to come out of first period. Wait for it! Not that chunky kid, the oatmeal kid, that’s what we’re all here for. High five, high five, yeah. If you wanted your kid to get f*cked, just to prove to your neighbors in your gated community that your kid’s hotter than their kid, and you sent your kid out as bait and you put him in a Catholic schoolgirl skirt with no underpants, and you made him hop on a pogo stick to school, you know, so, so his little pink, fleshy hindquarters shown so temptingly towards traffic, he would still probably graduate school having never been pooned, and then what an asshole you’d look like, trying to brag around a gated community at the next cocktail mixer. “It’s just by the grace of God that no one, no one ever f*cked him. It’s only ’cause of my hypervigilance and the work of my congressman getting more laws passed on the Internet, that he never got f*cked.” If I were a parent, I would prefer that pedophiles be on the Internet. There’s no more pedophiles in the world than there ever have been. They act like the Internet is creating pedophiles, where there were none. If I were a parent, if you exist anyway, stay on the Internet, stay jacking off in your basement in South Carolina as opposed to the old-fashioned way where they actually went down to your schoolyard. They did laps around the playground, smarties on a fishing line, trying to flyfish little Junior into the Oldsmobile. Keep beating off on the Internet. Just don’t f*ck the kid. That’s what it’s about, right? Just don’t f*ck the kid. That’s all you should worry about. But that’s not what the-the f*cking, the Attorney General, his, he says his, his number one focus is to stop the kid-f*cking, but he doesn’t, he wants to go after the Internet. He’s not going after the guy with the kid and the camera. He just… they use that fearmongering to get more government control in your life, more legislation, more, “Oh, no, I don’t want to have to be responsible for my own kid. You take care of it, Mr. Government. And if I get tired of it, I’ll just vote for the other party. And that’ll make a difference.” Child pornography, rampant on the Internet. Have you seen it? Attorney General, “Oh, we need to stop this. Child pornography is rampant on the Internet. We need more government involvement because… I’ve never seen child pornography on the Internet. But I’ve seen every other type of deviant, grotesque, sometimes stimulating, always clever, every other type of pornography that two eyeballs can absorb. You get into one good fruitless coke yank, where you’re all gacked up on blow and you’re just beating off till the band plays, ’cause hookers won’t answer their phone at this hour. You’re… You know it’s not gonna work. It ain’t gonna finish it. This is a cold, dead eraser in your hand right now. Wake up! You punch it in the face. You f*cking wake up and talk to me! You were awake when we bought this shit. You’re waking up now! And you just start clicking on random porn links, and you got popups everywhere, and that chick looks hot, click on that, and you go everywhere. You just keep seeing shit. It’s never what it’s advertised. 18yearold amateur hot coed action and you click on it and it’s some f*cking bondage enema porn, some f*cking… amputee porn. I’ve seen what, prego popper, a f*cking lactating mama, all, a flattop f*cker. I mean, they all sound like funny shit, they all exist. And-and-and shit, I make fun of, midget porn, it’s funny to say but it’s out there. It’s like the comic-relief porn I look at after I’ve just jacked off to something hugely uncomfortable, and I go, “Oh, well, let’s go look at midget porn and laugh. “Ha, ha, ha! Someone’s into this. You f*cking… You gaytard.” But it’s all out there. All this shit. Never saw someone f*ck a kid. I’ve seen three old queers. Go to my Web site. On the forum on my Web site, seriously. They have a thread called “The Tsunami of Poon,” where all these guys just post the most disturbing pictures to f*ck with everyone else. Three old queers is… three old guys in their 70s. They look like, any kind of, you know, fez-wearing f*cking Shriners, but now they’re all naked. One’s sucking the other one’s dick and the other two are making out very passionately, which is more disturbing than even the blowjob, as the other two silver-haired… It’s like, “Ah!” Seen that. Never seen the child porn. I’ve seen cock-fingering on the Internet. Have you seen… Cock-fingering. I’ve seen it several times randomly surfing porn. Digit in the male urethra. Objects in the male urethra. Seen cock-fingering, seen it several times, yet I’ve still never managed to see someone f*ck a child randomly. So if-if child pornography is rampant on the Internet, cock-fingering is probably occurring in this room as we speak. (cheering and applause) I have no children. If I, if I had children… O-Once people have kids, they get all f*cking weak and they have that genetic defect that makes them want to protect, but make other people like the government do it for them. I don’t, I don’t have a child. Maybe I’d feel differently if I did. “Well, once you have kids…” I don’t know. I know I’ve had an abortion… with my wife, and it’s been five years probably now. I just want to say… still a great decision. Every Roe v. Wade antiabortion rally that comes out, they’ll find some f*cking crying cunt from a trailer park and put her behind a podium and pat her back so she gets attention, and she goes, “I regret it to this day. I had an abortion because I was in a lot of trouble, and I wish I had that baby back in my arms.” Us—we don’t agree on much, my wife and I, but we agreed that was the best decision we ever made.Still, five-year anniversary, glad we f*cking killed the baby. Five years later, still glad, still happy, no guilt, no regret. Have a lot of regrets about how we handled the relationship, but never the baby, never brought up. I’m just saying. In case you ever come to that point “I’ll regret it down the line.” We haven’t. You don’t hear that side of the story. I’m just saying. I got, I got an, I got this antiabortion flier. They were, they were sticking them under everyone’s windshield wiper in the parking lot of this place in Texas. It had a picture of a dead fetus on the front. You know how the prolife folk are so fond of the dead fetus photo? They get a picture of an aborted fetus, and they run home and they blow it up large on a placard and they bring it down to their protest rally and they shove it in your face at 9:30 in the morning. “Look at that! Look at that! This is what abortion does right there. Don’t you turn away! This is abortion.” You’re like, “I’m just going to the ATM. I’m not going in this place. Clear the sidewalk, lady, I’m hungover. I’m about to f*cking barf anyway.” But they, they do that. The idea is that that picture is supposed to be so disturbing and so disgusting that it will singlehandedly change your whole view of the abortion issue, a-as though live childbirth were really pretty to look at, when that living monster is actually ripping out of you. (yelling) It’s all covered in blood and mucus, and sputum is flying everywhere and the f*cking thing’s screaming. You’re f*cking screaming. Everybody is screaming. Your husband is vomiting through a surgical mask while trying to maintain a comforting eye contact. “That’s pretty, baby. I love you…” And now your snatch and asshole have all been torn into one big, open septic manhole. “Look at it! Don’t you turn away.” Oh, yeah, you put a picture of that under my windshield wiper, I’ll frame it and put it over the piano. That’s… that’s adorable. That’s a little sweetheart. But this little peaceful freeze-dried aborted fella laying all nighttime on a comfy pillow next to a ruler—he’s disgusting. Ugh. Shame be that. Like I said, I’ve had an abortion, I’ve been party to an abortion, so… And we don’t know what became of it. When we had an abortion, we just shuffled out the front door. We didn’t tag its ear or keep in touch or track it on a GPS system. Pen pals– no, we f*cking left. So if I see a picture of an aborted fetus, there’s that part of you that’s got to wonder a little bit… “Hey. Steve, anything? He really look like me at all? Come on. Come on. There’s a little bit. I think he’s got my scowl.” If you’ve had an abortion… it really makes the whole idea, the… the whole concept of Heaven a lot more disconcerting, if you’ve had an abortion. As irrational or illogical as that idea is, it’s still, it’s depressing to think about if there were a heaven, and that… you fought through the white light and got up to the pearly gates, that’d be the first dead relative waiting for you there, all angry and pinch-faced. “Oh, look who’s here. Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, took your time, didn’t you? Yeah. Huh, looked like you were having a lot of fun down there. You know they took pictures of me! They took pictures of me! Laid me next to a ruler, for Christ’s sake.” ♪ Would you know my name? ♪ So I… So I get the flier. It’s got the dead fetus on the front. On the back of the thing, it’s got the whole prolife propaganda screed. At the bottom, the guy who prints these things for a living, for fun, or profit, or whatever his motivation is—he puts his name and phone number at the bottom, in case you want to order more. And I’m drunk with a phone. (muttering) And the guy answers his phone. It’s not even, it’s not even a business. It’s a dude in rural Wisconsin answering his phone in the bedroom. And I want to f*ck with him, but I want to be original. You don’t just want to be drunk and try to throw logic at this problem. You’re just going to waste cell phone minutes. That’s like trying to kick water uphill. You ain’t going to win. So what I did is I came at him and I attacked him from the more conservative angle, where I accused him of being the worst type of child pornographer on this planet. “This is sick. I can’t believe what I’m looking at, sir. This is a child in this photograph. That’s not a choice; that’s a child, and for you to distribute photographs of naked children around my neighborhood, you’re attracting the most deviant type of child predator on this planet. Right now, preterm necrophiliac child molesters are masturbating like frenzied apes in cages to your handiwork, sir. Don’t you dddduh me. You knew what you were doing. You could have Photoshopped a bikini onto that little baby. You could have airbrushed a tasteful one-piece, but you chose not to ’cause this is how you get your rocks off and I hope you burn in hell.” (cheering and applause) I don’t get here very often. I’m glad I had the opportunity again. (cheering and applause) So I… so I, so I can close strong and say f*ck the Yankees. I want to close with “F*ck the Yankees!” Yeah, f*ck the Yankees. How about that? F*ck the Yankees. F*ck you and your Yankees. F*ck the Yankees. (crowd members yelling) Yes. F*ck the Yankees for several reasons. You want to go through all of them? F*ck the Yankees—A: they bought their team. Yes, they bought the team. They spent the most money; they’re supposed to win. Like, okay, not fu… if you have money on the Yankees, different story. If you have money on any team, okay, go ahead and cheer for that team. It’s kind of like having stock in a company—you have an investment, you’re cheering for that—but if you’re just going to be some f*cking bloat-headed alcoholic drinking overpriced beer in the stands, paying too much money for parking, and they’re going to yell for a team, have some character and pick an underdog. If you’re just yelling to yell, pick an underdog. Why not? The Yankees are supposed to win. So for you to be a dildo arrogant fan on top of that? That’s like going to a casino and cheering for the house. And being an asshole about it. (grunts) (cheering and stomping) F*cking zip up to the f*cking Indian casino. Just set up shop right behind a blackjack table and go, “Oh, dealer busted your ass, bitch, huh? That’s my f*cking dealer. I chose that dealer. I got my deal… dealer hat on. I spent food money for this hat. I’m hungry.” What the f*ck is that? And f*ck the Yankees most ’cause they’re the reason that you have to go outside to smoke cigarettes. And the reason that they just banned trans fat in food. They’re telling you how to eat in this city, how to live your life, what you can do on your own property. They just banned f*cking. They’re trying to ban, uh, f*cking iPods in crosswalks. State supreme court in this state ten days ago upheld a ban on dancing in nightclubs. Anybody know this? Nightclubs. Not, not f*cking Utah, not Footloose. New York City! Tough guys, aren’t you? You’re f*cking standing out like f*cking bitches smoking outside. They tell you what you can put in your food, what you can eat, where to dance, where to walk. Can’t f*cking use my cell phone behind the wheel of my car, but tough motherf*cker. Before you advertise how tough you are, you might want to go into the bathroom and douche some of Bloomberg’s cock smell out of your assholes because it seems to me that you are just little bitches to City Hall, and that’s why I say “F*ck the Yankees,” too, ’cause the Yankees, what you were all rallying around and getting pumped up and badass about, when you should have been down at City Hall, 60,000 of you getting f*cking amped up the next time someone even mentions a smoking ban. There should have been 60,000 of you pricks f*cking booing and throwing batteries at the guy who suggested it. You distracted motherf*ckers. (cheering and applause) I’ll see you outside smoking. I’m not shilling applause. This is where credits roll. It’s kind of part of the thing. I’d rather be back there. Go ahead. Sit down. I don’t want this. It’s not real. You’re lying. I like you anyway. F*ck the etiquette. Just sit quietly. It’ll be, it’ll better credits if you all just sit. That’ll be credits. That would be real for, like, 60% of my shows. All right, can I go now?

You’ve got to just fuckin” come out of a book, you know, surprise your neighbours! Hey! A fucking big book next door, yes” Andy Warhol said, “You’ve always gotta come out of a book at some point,” he said, and then, poof! And big hair” Or he said something like that. So we’re here, yes”This is the video, a very, very special video a video album, this is what it is” of all the incredibly funny things” in my brain, I suppose, “cause people think I’m on drugs, and I’m not, I’m really quite, you know”just a bit of coffee, and I’m really” When I take drugs, I start going, “Oh, insurance! Ever thought of”? And pensions! Very sensible!” So don’t take drugs, otherwise you”ll go like that! Just go” Yeah! But thimbles is what I really wanted to talk about, because you don’t really well, they don’t get enough press these days, do they? I don’t think they ever did, because very rarely you see, “”Thimbles: Oh!” Says Man” You know what I mean” “Cause my Gran said, “Put a thimble on your finger, and it helps you, in case you slip with a needle, the needle goes up, and into brain, and death”” and before thimbles were invented, it was” “Needle Death ” Tragic ” Whole Family! Family of Sewers ” Tragic! “If Only Thimbles Were Invented,” says psychic man with big hat” and beard to match” “Thimbles Compulsory for Children in Many Buses” So ” yes” The best thing with thimbles is to put one… on each finger, and then you can do impressions of horses. Horses with one too many legs, I suppose” “Cause they do have a metallic sound, don’t they, horseshoes? Well, horses have got hooves, they’ve got this bit of semicircular metal… nailed to each and every foot! And that’s just a con! For centuries, blacksmiths saying, “Is that your horse? Better nail a bit of semicircular metal to each of his feet!” “Oh, no, thanks, it’s got hooves! Thanks very much.” “No, better nail a bit of semicircular metal on. Have you ever had a blowout on a horse doing 70? Yeah”” “Steel radials, that’s what you want, mate! Are those antilock hooves?” “Ooh, I’m not sure”” It is. Perhaps it’s a big con, they’ve done it very successfully for centuries, but they were just trying with all hoofed animals. “You got any more in your farm? Cows! Bring them in, they’ve got hooves! And pigs and sheep, hooves the lot of them! I’ll put shoes” And your ducks and geese, get the whole bloody farm in! And your next door neighbour. The whole farm for 50 quid”” Ducks going around, going “clang, clang, clang”” “Quack!” Swimming out in the water” They don’t do the breaststroke, do they, ducks? Any duck doing that is really kind of crap. And it’s also lucky, horseshoes are lucky! And horses have four bits of lucky nailed to their feet. They should be the luckiest animals in the world! They should win all their horse races, shouldn’t they? “It’s after 3:30, and today, every single horse was first equal” One horse dropped a shoe, came in fourth” And the duck was ninth. Five ran”” It’s what they always say at the end, don’t they? A bit of useless ” “five run.” Are there people at home, going, “But how many run?” Or is it the idea, “Five run, one sauntered, really” one drove a small car” one windsurfed, one “hangglid.” Yeah, you decline the verb “to hangglide,” then I hangglide, you hangglide, he, she hangglides, we hangglid, you hangglided, they “hangglidededed.” Anyway, that’s all rubbish! Sometimes, though, you want to buy a thimble, or a horseshoe, or a bit of fluff, or an elephant, and you go down your local supermarket. Don’t laugh too much, please” The local supermarket, you know; the hypermarket, they’re big, fuckoff, huge, big as a village these days, And everyone”s in there: trendy people, straight people, rich, poor; everyone in there, pushing trolleys, going, “Do we want yoghurt? I don’t know”” And you can push things around, you can fill up with stuff, and then you get bored of your shopping. “Oh, forget that! I don’t want it!” You can just leave your trolley, kind of” No, I’m just” ” Pick another one, “Oh, I’ve got this one!” But trolleys, they never run straight, do they? Have you ever flown on a trolley? Never! Because they’ve always got the wobbly wheel off to the right, hit someone in the stomach, and they drop all their shopping in, and then you’ve got their shopping” And if you hit an old lady, you get hairnets and dog food! At a certain age, about 80, I think, they go, “Fuck everything else! Hairnets and dog food, that’s all I need now”” “Cause you’re on bonus time from then on, really, so you might as well get weird shit. “Hairnets and dog food.” Hairnets, of course, are pointless; we’ve all known this, and we’ve marveled at people putting them on, “cause when you take them off in the morning, you’ve got crisscross patterns on your hair. “Why, old lady? Why the hairnet?” “Oh, the hair thieves! The hair thieves, they come in the night” Steal your hair, they do! Sell us into slavery” in Azerbaijan. ” And dog food as well. There was a dog food a while back called “Mr. Dog.” It was a small can of dog food for small, yappy-type dogs. And there was a big advertising campaign, saying, “Buy Mr. Dog, for small, yappy-type dogs” and maybe, they’ll shut the fuck up!” So that was fine, and then there was a “stroke your beard meeting” back at Mr. Dog”s headquarters. “Well” we’ve sold but two cans of “Mr. Dog””” which some people do say, “But two cans” Let’s change the name!” So they changed the name, from “Mr. Dog” to “Cesar.” Now that’s a bit of an image shift in my book of references. “Mr. Dog” ” small dog, yes, you can see the sort of linky there. “Caesar” ” Roman leader 2,000 years ago, small dog. Bit of a strangled route up to that one, isn’t it? Left at the traffic lights to get there” I think that’s a 3:00 in the morning decision, that one. “It’s “Caesar,” we’ll call it “Caesar”! Yeah, yeah, fucking “Caesar”! He was a Roman leader” Yeah, small dogs are Roman leaders, aren’t they? All right, “Caesar”! But we’ll drop the “a” out, right?” “Cause it was CAESAR, for some reason. I don’t think Caesar was going 2,000 years ago, “I have defeated Pompeii, I’m first Emperor of Rome! I wear the laurel wreath, with the front bit bitten out” In 2,000 years” time, I shall be remembered as a can of small dog food for small, yappytype dogs” and I shall be played by James Mason in the film. Yes, I shall, I shall”” That’s what he used to do, didn’t he, James Mason? Eh” “Here”s Jimmy!” No, he didn’t, that’s a lie. It would have freaked us out if he did! Ladies and gentlemen, James Mason!” “What are you doing, James?” Sorry, forget all that bit; we’ll cut that out. Now” Oh, yes! And supermarkets, yes” As soon as you go in, have you noticed? They do psychological tricks on us. As soon as you go in, you hit fresh fruit and veg. You noticed that? Every single time! You go to France, Germany, fresh fruit and veg, and it’s psychological, you go in, thinking, “This is a fresh shop! Everything here is fresh! I will do well here”” It is, think about it! You never go in to the toilet paper section, with the loo brushes and the squeeze” “cause then you go, “This is a poo shop! Everything here is made of poo! I’m not shopping here, I’m” going to Azerbaijan!” I knew I didn’t need to mime any further, you got the drift” Yeah, so” and all these fruits have got vitamins-vitamin A, of course, which is good for vitamin B, which we all know is very good for vitamin C is good for scurvy, isn’t it? Yes! There’s a lot of scurvy around these days” People phone in, “I can’t come in to work, I’ve got scurvy, yes” Well, I live on a houseboat and” Yeah, frothing at the mouth, yeah” the old Captain Cook problem there”” They’ve got vitamin D, which again is good for Vitamin E, which is good for skin, and then that’s it, no more vitamins. The whole vitaminnaming committee are going, “Let’s see, vitamin F. Suggestions? Oh, fuck it! I’m off down the boozer” Azerbaijan.” And all these people made food, like Granny Smith. Granny Smith made apples. Who was this woman, Granny Smith? “My name is Mrs. Smith, I’ve made apples out of bread, a dripping and a bit of green paint, and corrugated iron.” “No, these are horrible apples, Mrs. Smith. Go away, Mrs. Smith! Go away until your daughter has a baby.” “Shag, daughter, shag! It’s a marketing idea, shag for babies! My daughter’s had a baby, I’m Granny Smith now!” “Come in, Granny Smith! You a wonderful idea, you! Come in with your shiny apples.” “Brought family member, Mr. Delicious. He’s got apples ” Gold Delicious. Come in, Gold. King Edward, abdicated the throne, took up potato-making, there we go” Mrs. Simpson, jewellery” And there’s Hitler as well, they used to hang out together, and Jeff Bruckley, of the Bruckley family.” It’s all about threes” apples are great, apples are user-friendly, just big, hearty you grab “em, you go… and then you start to eat them, and” Always do the dog impression first, and when you get close to the pips in the middle, you go, “Ew!”… and you throw it away, in case you swallowed a pip and a tree comes out of your head. We know this to be true” And oranges! There’s a big war, don’t know if you know, but there’s this sort of internal war going on between the big, oldfashioned oranges, big, fuckoff, kind of” Stalinist, big, fuckoff” kind of oranges, and the new baby Satsuma, Minneola, kumquat, MG” Satsumari, kind of” Big fat war on that, because to eat a Satsuma, it’s a piece of piss, you just go… And you break off these one by one, don’t you? And you’ve got so much of it, and if there’s people in the room, you go, “Go on, go on!” It’s like a very cheap round, isn’t it? “Go on, Satsuma for everyone!” And if you’re the other person in the room, you go, “No, no” Well, all right, yeah” Thank you very much.” Yeah” So Satsumas are great, eating”s a piece of piss, but you can’t do it with an orange. You go, “You want a bit of orange? I’ve got” fucking “ell! Can’t fucking” hell”” “Cause inside an orange it’s like the film “Das Boot” in there! With J”rgen Prochnov going, “Don’t let them get in to the orange! It’s most important! Or the juice will get out, and it”ll not be good. They’re breaking in with fingers, depth charges! Let the peel come off only in small chunks!” “Shit! Jesus Christ!” “They’re breaking in! Push all the pips into bits they wouldn’t expect, that’ll do!” ‘Cause it is! There’s no chance of someone eating an orange, going, “Hey!” “You’re very nice”” There’s not a chance of someone who speaks like that anyway” So oranges can fuck off, that’s what I say! And pears can fuck off too! “Cause they’re gorgeous little beasts, but they’re ripe for half an hour” and you’re never there! They’re like a rock, or they’re mush! In the supermarket, people are hammering in nails” “We’re just putting these shelves up, mate, then you can have the pear.” Really, “cause you do do that squeezysqueezy thing on fruit, where you go “Oh..! Squeezy, oh”” It’s a test squeezy thing, that you’ve seen French chefs do on telly. “Oh, squeezy, oh”” But I have no frame of reference, so I’m going, “Oh” Is that good? I’m squeezing it about this much ” is that a good squeezy?” “Cause it seems like such an expert thing! They seem to go” “This one!” They don’t even look at it, they just” Sometimes they go “Oh, shit! No, it’s got a hole in it, I’m not really”” Or just put it on the end of a broom” “Yeah” it’s the manager!” So fuck pears” Pears are like a rock, so you think, “I’ll take them home and they’ll ripen up,” and you put them in a bowl, and they sit there going, “No! No! Don’t ripen yet! Don’t ripen yet! Wait till he goes out of the room! Ripen now! Now! Now!” And you come back in, and you go, “I’ll just have one of these”” “Hey, these pears are dead! These are dead pears, man. Hey, what happened guys?” They’re all going” And then there’s banana skins as well. There’s bananas and their skins; there’s all this sort of slipping on a banana skin and hilarity that’s been around for many years. Now I don’t know about you, but I’ve never actually, in my life, ever seen anyone actually slip on a banana skin in reality. I’ve never seen documentary footage of anyone slipping on a banana skin; I’ve heard the stories, oh, yes! People have told me stories” The Nazis did propaganda” So it’s all those fruits there, and there’s South African fruit we can have now, without going, “Oh, the guilt!” And star fruit, which are from Mars! So it’s great, you’ve got all these fruits, and you get a selection, you take it home, you arrange it in a bowl” and then you watch it rot! You never eat it, really” Occasionally, you go up to it, and go “Ah” I don’t think I will. Ooh, a Mars bar, there we go!” “Oh, I’m full-up now!” And they all rot from the bottom up, you go” Except for the oranges, that sit in the back and go, “No!” You chuck all the rest away, and the oranges are sitting there, going” for months it sits there” in a Stalinist kind of way. So, yeah” And there’s also labels in supermarkets; you’ve got labels on the food stuff now, so you can-it says “Four grams of protein,” you go, “Ah!” Is that good? Is that far too little protein? Is it you’re gonna die of protein shortage, or you’re gonna overdose on it? “0.02 milligrams of sodium.” Sodium explodes in water. Do I need 0.02 milligrams of that? Calcium-can you overdose on calcium? Can you go” “Well, I think there’s too much calcium in your diet.” “Yes, that’s what I thought.” “Are you eating a lot of chalk salad?” “Yeah”” So you make your choices of stuff in the supermarket, and you go down to where the queues are, and there’s 30, 40, maybe a million queues there! And you always choose one of those aisles when you’re walking down, it’s kind of enclosed in the aisle, isn’t it? There’s all this stuff there, and suddenly… It’s out, and there’s all the queues, and you know you’ve got 30 seconds to choose your queue, and you’re going” We’re all very good at queue strategy now, have you noticed? No one taught us this, we just go” We’re going, “Okay, 4, 4 looks pretty good” 7. No, no, quite a few people, all hand baskets. Hand baskets are good” It”ll move fast. 17 just opened! You take the French bread, you go on 17! I’m on 4. Keep in touch, keep in touch. Whoever gets there first, we’ll join and we get out, OK? Dropout on 7! I’m on 7! Shit, they’re paying with Luncheon vouchers! I’m back on 4! I’ve lost 4! You bastard! I left my aura there”” Always a good one” unless you get a ticket for parking. “Your aura is parked there.” “Oh, sorry.” You’re fine, usually, in the queue, until you see someone about three meters behind you pull up in a queue, and then there’s a bit of a delay, and they’re almost paying! They’re almost out! And you’re going, “Come on! Come on, there’s a war on, you know?” And the new queue, that’s what I’m always looking for, the new queue; that is the end of the rainbow, that’s where all the gold in the world is stacked, the new queue! “Cause you could be fifth, sixth in that sort of 15minute queue, and “New queue!” You’re in there! And the fastest, the most agile, the keen minds are there, and you’re looking in advance for potential new queues. People around the till, putting money in, and as soon as you see it going on the till” But not too obvious, otherwise everyone else in the queue sees you” so you just keep one eye on it, and try” “Look over there! There’s a badger with a gun! Can you see? Surely he’s going to kill” new queue!” But then you’re not sure are they opening? Are they just mending the till? And you” you don’t want to” “Oh, you’re not? Oh, I was there! was there!” You can take all your clothes off and put them on a string, and then” “Oh, you’re not? Okay.” Depends on what you’re wearing, of course. A lot of you applaud, going, “Yeah! Oh, that wasn’t that good, was it?” But they’ve the beeping machines these days! There’s a bar code on all the stuff, and there’s a little sort of starshaped thing, and they just show it to it. Like the machine is going, “Yes, all right”” “Yes, that’s still fine.” And it must get boring! All day” and the excitement… that never happens… is when it goes” “Fucking make the noise! It’s some thing!” The machine is going, “No, I’m bored”” “Oh, go on! Make the noise!” “No, I don’t want to”” “I’ll read it at you. Thick one, thin one, thick one, thin one” thick, thick, thin” are you getting this? Thin” Oh, forget it! I’ll just type out… the handy 50digit number, I’ll be with you in a second.” “So much more efficient these days!” And you realize two sea anemones have taken over your hands” sometimes. Late night shopping in local petrol stations, that’s a form of 20th. Century shopping that I don’t think anyone would have thought it was gonna happen. And you’re there, at 3:00AM, especially in inner cities, this is 3:00AM, you’re at the petrol station, there’s a guy behind bulletproof glass, slumped over a desk, dead! Or asleep, you’re not sure, you don’t care; even if he is dead, you’re going, “Wake up! I want groceries”” And he wakes up, and you go, “Oh, sorry, mate, sorry, I just want” o, I don’t have a car I don’t have a car. I do not have a car.” There’s a big communication problem, isn’t there? They’ve built this bulletproof glass, and it’s sound proof! Try to talk through the thing” “I don’t want any” Some brown bread, I just want some brown bread. Right over there, brown” No, that’s diesel oil” Brown bread, brown” Two words, brown bread. First word, sounds like” brown. Brown! Brown bread!” 3:00 in the morning, and you get into this, and there’s a queue forming behind you” “No, it’s brown bread, brown” ” A queue of murderers! With different weapons! Someone on a camel about here” people from “Star Trek” down here” And you’re going, “Yeah, the brown bread! Get the brown bread, man! Just get it quickly!” You’re trying to give real fuckoff vibes around here, so that no one hassles you. “Yeah, bread for my bread gun!” “Give me the bread! What? Shredded wheat? That’s fine! I’ll eat that shredded” fuck it! I’ll put marmalade on it, it’s fine. And a packet of Rizzlers, thanks. “Why do I want them?” “I” I’m a stamp collector, and I’ve run out of stamps, so I thought… I’d get those clippy, plain ones, you know? Where you can draw your own stamp in on it. Fucking give it to me!” Then they do the dance of the tray “Aah! My hand! Thank you. Can I have a bag?” Then they put this very thin bag in, the thinnest bag in the world. So thin, you’re surprised you get everything into it” Then you go off, and the whole queue follows you. “Follow him! He speaks in sentences.” “No, no, you must hassle him now. He has the groceries.” “Oh, groceries! Yeah, yeah”” “Hello, we’re murderers. A Twix, please.” And they’re behind bulletproof glass there, because, you know, it’s late at night, people are hassling them, if they go in the shop, they try to nick stuff” And I must admit, I got caught nicking stuff when I was 15, and I was nicking makeup, back in Boots in BexhillOnSea. I could”ve bought it, I could”ve saved up and bought it, but I thought, if I bought it, someone might say, “Hey, you’re a boy buying makeup! You must be a transvestite!” And then I’d have to go, “Oh, Sherlock Holmes! How did you get to the bottom of that one, you big, deerstalker, weird, fucking hat person? Four dog ears!” Why is it called a deer stalker? Anyone stalking a deer now, the deer would go” “There’s a guy out there with four dog ears, with two strings hanging off.” “I’m a deer stalker! That’s a deerstalker!” Don’t know why, just a stupid hat, I think. Anyway, so I didn’t buy the makeup, I nicked it! And I had a loaf of brown bread, so I put it under this brown bread, and I run out of the shop and down Bexhill High Street, and they caught me! But I was 15, so they let me off with a warning, which was, “This lipstick is not gonna work with this eyeshadow, no way! That’s light blue, that’s a death colour! You want a bit of foundation in this, that’s very cheap foundation.” “Oh”” “That’s a warning!” “Oh, thank you, Chief Constable.” Also, I got done for jumping a 20p tube fare! This is my whole crime sheet, right? Which is quite an interesting read” 20p! This is not Don Corleone, this is Don Crap. I jumped a 20p underground tube fare, and I was waving a pass at the time, you know, it was drawn on a Rizzler or something; it was a Bishop of Durham pass. “I’m the Bishop of Durham” Oh, bless you, my son.” And the guy said, “You’re not Bishop of Durham! He wears a bigger hat than that!” So he got me. “I got him! I got the 20p kid! You’ve caused us “1.60 worth of trouble, you have, in your time. I’ve got him and I’ll be promoted in the underground system. I’ll get my own darkness!” Then an off-duty policeman came, and he had a pot plant and a camera, on his way home for a good night photographing pot plants, I suppose” This is all bizarre, but true; this is what he had, and he said, “I’ve got him too! Oh, I’ll get promoted” King of Metropolitan Police!” And I thought, “I’m going down for 20p! No, I’m gonna run for it! I’ll run for it like Mel Gibson in the film “Gallipoli,” and” other people in running films. So I run, and I run, and I run, and I run, and after five inches, they caught me” They called for backup, and now 20 policemen are coming down, thousands of pounds worth of police work ” “We’ve got the 20p kid! 20ps are safe from now on”” And three policemen pulled me for five minutes! I don’t know if you’ve ever had this, they grab one leg each, and I don’t know ” obviously, they were working together; they thought I was struggling like crazy, I’d given up at this point. One over here was going, “Don’t struggle, there! Don’t struggle!” People over here going, “Eh! Don’t you fuckin” struggle!” So it was a continuous machine of them pulling against each other, had one hand free, I was going, “Hi! How are you? I’ll talk about this in many years”” And then they put me in Bower Street overnight, and that became assaulting a police officer! Surely it was stretching a pedestrian! It was! I got down for assault, and I was running away! Assault is motion towards, I feel” it takes an accusative. Very rarely in war, they go, “Assault that hill over there!” “Let me do a bit of stretching here”” I should have been done for deserting a police officer. There’s a shop in South London which was a very” it’s still there, apparently. It’s in Tooting High Street, and it sells two very disparate items. On one side of the shop ” they put them on different sides, it’s great! One side is guns, and knives, and harpoons and fucking really mean fucking weapons. On the other side, there’s banjos, and violins, and bassoons, And you know about it, don’t you? Yeah! It’s fucking there! And what’s the guy doing? “Oh, we’re way down in weaponry, but up on banjos this week” That’s good, people are getting lighter these days, in tough times. They shift to music like crazy at the moment! Way down on bassoons!” hat, is this mad guy going” Someone browsing around” “An Uzi machine gun, slices a man in two, 200 rounds a minute, or” a banjo!” “A ukulele, like George Foreman.” You remember that famous fight, George Foreman against Muhammad Ali? That was very” A dyslexic promoter put it on, and it was brilliant” “I’m gonna kill him, I’m gonna kill him”” “Hey, turn that” ” Hey! Oh, it’s a big bugger! Who put me up for this gig? Fucking “ell!” The trainer comes up, “You’re doing well, you’re doing well!” “He”s fucking hitting me!” ~ Neverthless “You’re doing well, you’re doing well!” ~ “My ukulele is smashed. I’m going to that gun shop!” Guns & Banjos” interesting band. Now” It was a very wide reactiish thing. No, they’re gonna leave it in! You noticed that when people say, “Oh, we’ll cut this,” it’s always left in there? Anyway” Oh, I forgot my rest of the show! How does it go? two men went into a pub” and they totally redecorated it! It was brilliant! It’s an old joke” Oh, yeah, musical instruments! I played the clarinet, right? I wanted to play the piano, but somehow I got a clarinet. I don’t know quite how that worked” Five people can play the clarinet in the world, and they make quite a beautiful, wooden” It’s just a wooden noise, it floats” That’s not the noise, is it? It’s like a clarinet, but I played it like a foghorn being dragged through a place where foghorns shouldn’t be dragged. It was just” it was bad noise. And if you’re an adult, and you’re playing a musical instrument, you’re probably making some of this sound, cause you want to play it, your heart is in it, you’ve gotta have feeling, you gotta go” You can’t paint a picture if you don’t want to” “Oh” it’s the Eiffel Tower!” You know” “This is a splotch.” “It’s the Eiffel Tower.” You’ve gotta be in there. Now, if you’re a kid playing a musical instrument, there’s probably a certain element of parental pressure that’s going in there. “Yes, little Johnnie, you should play the violin, because I never had the chance when I was a child.” “Well, you’ve got the chance now, why don’t you learn it now?” “No” No, I don’t think I will. I have to watch telly and drive cars now, it’s the pressure of being an adult.” “But I don’t wanna learn! I want to go and smash things with hammers!” “Yes, I know, but if you were musical, oh, the world would be wonderful, and I would hear the wonderful noise”” “Oh, fucking “ell!” So the kid goes, “All right, I’ll learn the violin, but you won’t like it! I’ll make a bad noise! Practicing” “Oh, fucking “ell!” The violin like this, the cello is slightly bigger, with a spike on the bow that kills you, and the double bass you have to rest on a friend to play” I played the clarinet. And if you play a musical instrument; if you’re a kid and play a musical instrument, you want to play sexy tunes, don’t you? “I want to play sexy tunes! I want to play tunes so that other kids at school come up and say, “Hey, he”s playing sexy tunes!” People who I fancy say, “We must dance provocatively in front of him, like they do in films we don’t believe.” Playing the clarinet… “We will shag him as soon as we know how.”” That was where you wanted to go, wasn’t it? You wanted everyone to go, “Oh, wow, what a hip fucking dancey tune”” But all the music lessons just make you learn dirge! I was learning from this book called “A Tune A Day,” and” “This tune is called “Snug As A Bug In A Rug.” So, is this a sexy tune, Mrs. Badcrumble? I just don’t think, Mrs. Badcrumble, that this is really gonna be a sexy tune.” “No, it’s a totally sexy tune on the clarinet! I made love to this tune with my husband in 1481, I’ll have you know”” “You did? It’s a very sexy tune? All right, I’ll have a go. Here we go”” “At what point did you orgasm during this song, Mrs. Badcrumble? “All through it, it was multiple! They hadn”t been invented in 1481, but I got there” on a hangglider.” “You’re fucking nuts!” The clarinet’s got a wooden reed at the back, and you have to push it, you have to make” it’s not an ambesure, which is something else, it’s a kind of vegetable” that flute players have to deal with” and if you’re making a sound, you squeak. After a while, I was practicing and my Dad was going, “Stop practicing! I have bought a hammer! You may borrow it if you wish!” Oh, it was a dreadful, fucking noise! And the clarinet’s like that, but the oboe has two bits of wooden reed pushed together, you have to” It’s designed not to let any sound in! It’s like trying to blow in a weasel! The tuba! Who chooses to play a tuba? Surely a tuba is a punishment thing, surely it’s community service. “You’ve been sentenced to three years on the tuba.” “Oh, God!” Who wants to make” It’s got a huge horn, you can get a child in there! The trumpet’s okay, but it makes your cheeks go out to hamstersize; there’s a thing called a triangle, it’s just a triangle, it goes “ting!” Forget it, just with your mouth, go “ting!” The percussionists” “Where’s your fucking triangle?” “Oh, grow up!” They do that, people play these big cauldrons” it’s like doing it too loud” Yeah, true story” So there’s all these instruments, and I played third clarinet, right? The first clarinets played the melody, that’s okay, you know where you’re going; second clarinets played harmonies that back up the melody and sort of link, okay; third clarinets played the notes that are left over! It’s boring! The only exciting way to do it is really blow it loud! The teacher is going, “Piano! Piano!” You go, “It’s not a fucking piano! It’s a clarinet… you weird-talking person.” And then it was” These strange, fucking noises, and the teacher is going, “Oh, this is a Godawful band! I know, I’ll get the parents to listen to this. Then maybe they’ll kill “em!” And a big sign went up ” “School Band Will Play Tunes!” And no one from the local town came, no hip people said, “Hey, we’re going down the school, they’re gonna play a gig” I’m gonna stagedive on the bassoon player”” Just the parents came, and sat down, going” “Oh, they’re gonna kill us! We’re crap!” he teacher gets up, “The school band will now murder “O Come All Ye Faithful.” The song has been arranged with” no real care. Helmets will be worn during the production. Parents are going, “Oh” my” God!! We have spawned the devil! Let’s go and find hammers for them.” Poetry! Poetry is very similar to music, only less notes and more words. And there was a Scottish poet called Robbie Burns-Robbie Burns to Scottish people, Robbie Burns to English people, and Rabbi Burns to Jewish people” who turn up at his door and say, “What is the Hebrew translation”? “I don’t know, I’m a poet, I don’t know this” go away. Are you trick or treat?” “I need the translation”” And he wrote poetry, he wrote a big fucking book of poetry, but one of his most famous lines is “The Best Laid Plans O’ Mice and Men Aft Gang Aglay,” meaning “The best laid plans of mice and men often go wrong.” And because it’s poetry, people go, “Oh, I know what you mean there, Robbie, yes” Fucking plans ganging aglay… by a fucking truckload”” And being a poet, he must have observed humanity, must have said, “Men. Men make plans. These plans go wrong. Go wrong once, twice” often! Often, a number of plans I’ve seen go wrong” Possible idea for a poem”” And then he must have turned his attention to the other… animal mentioned in that line of poetry. If you think back to it, “The best laid plans of mice and men”” Exactly which mice plans was he really honing in here on? The best laid ones go aglay, some of the worse laid ones are okay? Some of them get through? He was fucking off this trolley! “See, mice also make plans, unbeknownst to most people. They plan to get cheese! They run, they scamper” Oh, one’s fallen over! No cheese today” Oh, plan two: they’ve got three, another one’s got a stick, he’s gonna put the stick into the mousetrap” No, he’s broken the stick! What a jessie! Plan three ” Oh, they’ve got a flip chart now! Very serious” there’s a lot of mise surrounding the meeting, and they’re having a discussion” Oh, good plan this, probably! Their best laid plan, I believe” I could just hear what they’re saying. One mouse is going,”You aren’t supposed to blow the bloody doors off! Told you about that” What are you doing, coming in here, and making such a fracas? Now tell me the plan.””Well, we’ll drive the Minis into the square”” “No, piazza.” “Oh, it’s piazza, Charlie? And we load the cheese in the back of the Minis, and we drove it at you during a football match.” “That’s right. Wallop, wallop, wallop, into the big coach driven by William, rounding in the Alps, and we’re free. And you’re sitting in the back, and you’re not having a migraine, and you’re gonna shut your face.” “All right, Charlie.” “Meanwhile, back in London, the Chief Mouse is talking to the prison governor”Somebody has broken into my toilet.” “Well, I’m terribly sorry.” “Get on to Camp Freddy, I want Charlie Crocker given a good going-over.” So if you haven’t seen “The Italian Job” this is all meaningless, by the way, but then, if you haven’t seen it, you probably haven’t lived” Yes, yes” And sayings as well! Sayings are very interesting… “cause they’re based on truth, then they have got a bit of old wives” tale on top, then a bit of a hazy farther, a bit of uncle banana… and then you’ve ice-cream on top, and it’s just rubbish! I mean, like “He doesn’t suffer fools gladly.” We go… Who does suffer fools gladly?! How often you can go, “Hello! I’ve got a pig in me trousers!” “Come in! That pig sounds like a dog.” “No, it’s a pig; I just can’t be bothered to do the impression. Can my friend come in? He”s got jam for brains” “Yes, come in, you fool!” The other saying was” what was the other saying? Oh, yes, “Go and teach your grandmother to suck eggs.” What on Earth is that one about? You’ve got a lot of freerange eggs, “All right, Gran, I’m gonna teach you to suck eggs.” “I’m not gonna suck eggs, I’m not! You piss off, you young children! There’s a mouse here making a plan, you see? Planning to scale the Eiffel Tower on a bat”” “Why are you Scottish, Gran?” “I don’t know” I’ve been taken over by Mrs. Badcrumble. Oh, my hairnet! It’s coming off” The hair thieves are upon us!” Now we do have haircuts, don’t we? Humans have haircuts, and sheep have haircuts, and poodles, and they’re the only three animals in the entire world, in the universe, as we know, to have haircuts. This is true, you don’t get ants going, You don’t get lions going, “I’ll go and get that antelope” Jesus Christ! I’ll put it in bunches, right?” The antelope”s going, “There’s a huge girl with big teeth coming after me! Run! Run!” The last one was the butterfly” Which is a pointless swimming stroke, isn’t it? Remember when you had to stand back in the swimming bars, and some big, fucking kid came through doing the butterfly? You just wanted to hit him with a floater. “Fuck off with your butterfly! Fucking showoff! We can’t even do doggypaddle yet! Bastard!” Anyway, we do get haircuts, and sheep get haircuts. Some sheep must be going into that shearing shed, going, “Hi, can I get a coffee? Thanks.” “Yeah, a little bit off the top, loose down the back, and sort of wedgeshaped, that’s quite in at the moment. That”d be great, thank you” thank you” “Well, it’s not quite what I was after”” “Do you have a hairnet?” I’ve done a bit of Latin in me time, but I can control it, you know. I never let it get out of hand, I just” have a dealer and” he sells me Latin transcripts, and you know, “Okay”” so that late at night you just feel like translating Latin for a bit, upstairs, smoking in the coats” room. I don’t know what I’m talking about now. No, I did, I did Latin, I learnt “Amo, amas, amat”” “Amo, amas, amatis, amant,” and it comes in handy. Yes! Sometimes you’re queuing at a petrol station at 3:00 A.M. in the morning, and there’s a line of murderers behind you, and you turn around and go, “Amo, amas, amat! Amo, amas, amatis, amant!” and they go, “Fuck! He knows Latin! He knows a dead language! Run! Run down the Fort Court!” Yeah, I remember you did it as “an option,” yeah” And the teachers with options were, “Yeah, learn Latin! You”ll get the whole underlying knowledge of all the European languages!” “Why don’t we just learn the European languages, then?” “That’s a good point, yes”” It’s very rare you’re at Frankfurt airport and someone”s going, “Ja mein Herr, was ist los?” and you’re going: “Sprechen Sie Latin? Pugnato sum” et kumquat and romanes avec gallum et” pugnato fish”..” “Ja, ja, aber was ist los?” “I don’t know, I don’t know, what ist los? Do tell me”” So I don’t think it’s very useful today, really, and they had language labs! Language labs came in when I was at school, and that was great; you get in that little cubicle, had a tape going around, the headphones on, and the tape would go, “O” est la plume de ma tante? Monsieur, o” est la plume de ma tante?” And you”d go, “La plume de ma tante est pr”s de la chaise de ma tante” as well you know”” And the tape would go: “Oui! Oui, la plume de ma tante est pr”s de la chaise de ma tante.” You”d go, “How does this tape know what I’m talking about?” And the tape would continue, “O” est la plume de mon oncle?” And you’d go, “La plume de mon oncle est bingy bongy boogy bongy” And the tape would go, “Non! La plume de mon oncle n’est pas bingy bongy boogy bongy ” qu’estce que vous d’tes? Vous “tes un putain!” “Je ne suis pas un putain. Je n’avais pas le sexe pour l’argent ” qu’estce que vous d’tes, vous cassette?” And the tape would go, “Oh, oh pardon. Je suis d’sol”, vous avez raison. je suis seulement un pauvre cassette. ‘Sous la chaise, je n’avais pas les pantalons’ Oh, it’s an old song”! Yeah” I did an exchange-ship with France; yeah, the teacher at my school said, “Do you want one of ours? He’s already loaded into the tuba.” And I went to a place called Ch’lons-Sur-Marne, it’s on the river Marne, otherwise it’d be “Ch-lons-Sur” no, nothing.” It’s in the Champagne region of France, which is North” North-East, and champagne is going on there all the time. They have loads of champagne, and they celebrate all the time. “You’ve crossed the road? Champagne! You’ve walked out of a shop? Champagne! You can lean over a bit like this? Champagne!” Big occasions ” “You had a baby? Here’s the beer.” So it’s a bit of a functional French town, every country’s got a bit of “oh!” Emotionally linked with Felix, though” And we were shown around places of interest… in Ch’lons-Sur-Marne; we were shown around the glue factory, you know. When you’re a kid, you go, “Oui, oui, le ” le usine de glue. C”est tr”s bien. ‘Voici l’usine de glue.’ ‘Voici la porte de l’usine de glue. ‘Merde.’ So we went around, they showed us glue… one pot, they lifted the lid, there was just glue going around, ‘Oui, c’est tr’s bien.’ And we ended up in a boardroom, and a bloke with a flipchart was saying, “Voici l’usine de glue. C’est le flipchart et” qu’estce que c’est? Le fromage? Les souris? “Le Job Italian”! Qu’estce que “Le Job Italian”? Qui est Charlie Croker? Mr Bridger”” Sorry, just gave you the whole list there. The cast list. So he said, “Oui, oui, c”est l”usine de glue. Ah ici, c”est” Ah, the glue making process, okay. Ici un cheval, pas de glue, un cheval, pas de glue, pas de cheval, beaucoup de glue!” “Oh, c”est merde pour le cheval!” ” Oui, c”est merde”” And it was an exchange trip, so we had to be reexchanged, you know, and this all took place in the crossChannel ferry, like it does. And all my teachers went down, we all went down on to the car deck, and… my teachers switched on the lights of their Rover and the Ch”lons teachers switched on the lights of their Citr”en. All my teachers got out with cricket bats and tennis rackets And all the Ch”lons teachers got out with French sporting equipment” a set of bulls. And my head teacher is going, “Send the English kid over!” So I was pushed off with a load of French bread” “C”est un cadeau, un cadeau!” “Oh, merci, merci”” And the French kid was coming over with a load of Brillo pads” “Oui, oui, c”est un cadeau de les anglais. C”est le shredded wheat. Ils sont tr”s generous, n”estce pas? Oui, oui, on peut le manger. Oui, un peu de lait, un peu de sucre” Et on mange, mange, mange, mange, mange, mange, mange, mange, mange, et apr”s, pas de dents!” If you don’t understand French, by the way, all of this is very funny, I assure it. But we’re Europeans, we can swing with it. I did German tapes as well! Big drop in your understanding. The tape”s going round and saying, “Wo ist das Kind, mein Herr? Wo ist das Kind?” And I’d go, “Das Kind ist in dem Flughaben” as well you know!” And the tape would go, “Ja, das Kind IST in dem Flughaben. Aber warum?” “Well, I’m not really sure” Perhaps he likes the airplanes.” And then we did Latin tapes as well, we did bloody Latin tapes, and they were just lies. It was pure lies because no one knew what the bloody accent was. They were trying to get you to learn the Latin accent, and they had NO IDEA! Because everyone was dead, it’s a dead language; the Romans, for all they knew, could have said, “Hello, we’re the Romans!” “Hello, we’re the Romans.” “We’re the Romans.” “Hello.” “We’re the Romans, we want to come in your country and take all your things.” They had no idea, so they lied, and they made up all this Roman accent, which was kind of floaty, it was “Puella est in cana.” And that was too floaty for me, because this is a very aggressive nation, very… I mean, they weren’t into democracy and diplomacy, “cause they were Greek words, and they’d invaded them” They went “round, invading countries, with organized men with stabby swords, stab, stab, stab” I just don’t think they went into Gaul, going, “Hello” Are you the people of Gaul? Wonderful! Well, we are the Romans. Yes, we are. And… you must be Chief Vercing’torix, is that right? No, I recognize you from the “Asterix” books. Well, we’re the Romans, I am a legionary; this is our leader, Mr. Dog.” Mr. Dog’s going, “Yes, I am. And a word with you, legionary, if I may” Thinking of changing the name, I am” Changing it from Mr. Dog to Cesar. Had a word with the marketing department” the marketing department of Rome, and it’s Mr. Cesar” Oh, I’m getting off this seesaw! Bring me my horse, thank you very much! There we go, that’s much better” Have we got steel radials on the back of this?” Yeah” Roman history was fascinating because… 2,000 years ago they murdered and killed a lot of people! But 2,000 years ago, “forgive and forget,” eh? Let bygones be “beegones.” Whatever a bygone is” That’s another saying, isn’t it? “Let bygones be bygones.” “What’s a bygone?” “Well, it’s a gone””Oh, it’s a thing that’s gone by, isn’t it? Forget it. That makes sense” So some sayings are true! So what you do is you hit someone, “Why the fuck did you do that for?” “Oh, it’s a bygone! It’s already done, it’s been done” No use crying over bygones. Look, the bygones are coming!” “It’s the fucking invasion of the bygones!” That’s quite good, isn’t it? “Invasion of the bygones!” They’re all going, “Look, it’s no bother, really.” That’s a very British invasion. “I’m terribly sorry, we’ve overstayed our welcome. We used to be imperialist bastards, but now we’re just coming quite politely. Hello”” Yes! Back in Roman times, when people died, they had professional mourners come in, which is a totally weird idea. “My husband is dead Mr. Claudius is dead. Oh, God”!” Which god”? Oh, Jove! “By Jove, he”s dead! Tragedy”” Not the other god that you’re thinking about. I’ll try this again” “Oh, my husband is dead!” Fuck it! Forget the whole thing. “My husband is dead, Mr. Claudius is dead” And there’s not enough grief! There’s not enough grief in this house to warrant his death, I wish to beef up the grief! Slave, get a message out to MournersRUs, will you? Tell them I wish to beef up the grief! Yes, let bygones be bygones. Here”s 10 denary for your trouble, and get them straight back here, slave. What do you think you’re doing?” And up will come a very smooth guy, “Good afternoon, I’m Mr. Marcellus. I’m from MournersRUs. Just a free sample there. Now”” “That’s very impressive!” “Yes… I told you… We can do both hands, ambidextrous. Oh, Mr. Claudius is dead, what a tragedy! A great man-was he a great man? I hope he was, yeah” A great big man, anyway. Well, we have several funerals on offer this week, we have a special on, the cheap one we call it “Oh, bum, he’s dead!” funeral. It’s our bargain, 25 denary, and that’s just Mr. Claudius out front, and just myself about 10 meters behind, just a little bit pissed off.” “Oh, bum!” “That’s the “Oh, Bum!” funeral, not much bother, shove him in the ground, no problem. For a full 50 denary, we got myself and Flavius here, at either side of the funeral cort”ge, slightly more geared up, slightly more, “Oh! Tragedy! Tragedy! He was a great man”” We could have a CV at this point” “Oh, he made jam” played the ukulele, all these things” in the George Foreman quartet” and we’ll poke people with sticks to make them cry more. “Go on, cry, you bastards!” That’s our 50 denary. And for a full 100 denary, you get all four of us carry the deceased along, and then we gently lower him into the ground on straps” and then we’ll twang him into a tree!” That end bit isn’t really authentic, is it? But just to tail off the whole piece, so I started twanging him into trees! And it gets a big laugh, and then I carry on” That’s comedy for you! But we’re kind of lugubrious about, you know, funerals and people dying, and… we always mourn the death throughout, when celebrating the life… is a different attitude. And I think, “twang “em into trees!” That’s what I say. Wouldn’t you rather die and be twang into a tree? The jury is out for that one, you know” Just think about it, give a lot of fun to people” “Oh, it didn’t! Bring it back, bring it back” Come on! Duel funerals” Funerals on bonfire night” It’s an option, we can go that way if we want to. So, yeah” Also, back in Roman times, Pliny The Younger wrote letters. He was a letterwriter, it’s a great bloody profession, isn’t it? “Oh, I’m gonna write some letters today… April 7th”” He”d just write postcards, “”ello. Bye!” “Cause people do write really crap postcards, you know. “I’m here. You’re not. Bye!” Or you start getting interesting, just at the bottom of the postcard, and you start writing all along” Anyway, I don’t know that Pliny did postcards, but he wrote from Vesuvius; he was at Mt. Vesuvius when it erupted, on the West coast of Italy, back in A.D.  which is a wary man. No, it was 8079, right? So that’s kind of the time period, and he was there. “Dear Father, I am here at Vesuvius, it is erupting as I speak. The top”s come off the mountain! There’s stuff everywhere! Send ships and big ships. Send fucking dogs” Get on to Mr. Dog, tell them to send people” Apart from that everything”s gorgeous. Got a great tan, even though we all have it “cause we’re in Italy. Love and kisses, Pliny the Younger. P.S.: Nothing.” Yeah” And St. Paul, he wrote letters, didn’t he? “St. Paul”s Letter to the Corinthians. Always writing to the Corinthians. “St. Paul”s letter to the Corinthians ” Chapter 1 ” Verses 1 to 53. Dear Corinthians, as you can tell from my preamble, it’s gonna be quite a long letter. Don’t do bad things, only do good things. Always treat your neighbour like someone who lives near to you. Never put a sock in a toaster. Never put jam on a magnet. Never throw your Granny in a bag. Never suck all the juice out of a vampire. Never lean over on Tuesday”” “Lots of other things, but I gotta go and have a Mars bar now. Love, Paul (Saint).” Is that how he wrote his name? B.A. honours.” Yeah, so he wrote this ” “All right, that’s the end of the letter”” “The Corinthians” Corinth.” They must”ve been real fucked off over in Corinth, don’t you think? The postman going, “Come on, one of you Corinthians, gotta take this letter.” “Oh, fuck off! That’s from old mourner St. Paul, isn’t it? No” I don’t want it, I don’t want it!” “You gotta take it. Come on, I gotta have a signature for it.” “Oh, fuck off! It says “the CorinthianS” ,plural. Ask someone else. What does it say”? “Don’t do this, don’t do that” Never put a sock in a toaster? Jam on a magnet”” Ooh, he”s lost his brain, ain”t he? Whose idea was it to be a penpal with St. Paul anyway? That fucking backfired, didn’t it? He”s supposed to stop doing it at about 15, he”s been doing it for years” Come on, Corinthians, come on, general meeting. We’re gonna write a letter back to him, stop all this rubbish.” “The Corinthians” Letter Back to St. Paul, Chapter 1 Verses 1 to a million. More letters to follow. Tuesday 28th… of something. Dear Paul (Saint, apparently), FUCK OFF! Why do you keep sending these letters? You arrogant bastard, you send a letter to an entire city! What do you want us to do, put these up in a board or something? You’re coming on like Alistair Cooke, for fuck”s sake! “Never put a sock in a toaster,” what’s all that about? Love and kisses, the Corinthians. Kiss, kiss ” Steve the Corinthian, Fred the Corinthian, George the Corinthian”” “There we go ” St. Paul” Outside Corinth” And the Carthaginians as well! Oh, they gave the Romans hell! Because they attacked Rome, the Carthaginians did, over the Alps on elephants” and the Romans were never expecting that. The Romans were there, going, “What? The Carthaginians attacking? What? Attacking over the Alps? Damn! I knew they”d do that! They’re coming on elephants? Where did they get the elephants? There aren’t any elephants in Europe! This I’ve gotta see” Are you sure? You sure it’s just not a typo mistake? “The Carthaginians are attacking, they’re coming over the Alps in their element”? They’re coming on fucking elephants”” They weren’t gonna, you know, they were gonna come on skis, of course. That was the way in down the fucking Alps. But their leader, Hannibal, and his brothers, Hasdrubal, Haveaball and Haveabanana, whose real name was, “whoa! Have a banana”” And Hannibal went to the shop, and said, “Skis for all my men! We’re gonna attack the Romans over the Alps.” And the guy said, “Sorry, I didn’t catch that.” “We’re gonna attack the Romans over the Alps, in fact.” “Oh, all right. Well, fresh out of skis at the moment. The last pair just went to” someone.” “Oh” that’s a bummer.” “We’ve got some elephants, though”” “Are they good at skiing?” “Oh, tops! Top skiers there”” “Cause elephants were much more lithe back in Roman times, much more like Austrian skiing instructors are today” Off the tops of those roofs of chalets” What about the people who lives in those wooden huts? Stop skiing off my roof, you bastards! All my life living at Heathrow, coming out here” fucking “ell! Bit of peace of quiet and whoom! Fucking elephants on my roof! Sorry about that, Mrs. Badcrumble! Anyway” So you think I should take up the clarinet, do you?” “Yes, I do, I think it”d be very good. Mr. Cesar here has been learning the clarinet for some time now.” “Yes, I have, it’s a very good instrument” It’s very sexy. I’m learning “Snig as a Bug in a Rig.”” “Isn’t that “Snug as a Bug in a Rug”?” “Yes.” “Well, I’ll go on, Mrs. Badcrumble. I mean, you know, I’m just” Why am I Australian, by the way? “I don’t know.” “My country hasn’t even been invented yet” except by the indigenous tribes who lives there”” Whoa, there we go! I don’t know what all that bit’s about” “Sorry about living here in this hut” Fuck off my roof! I’m gonna put a huge hairnet up, that’s what I’ll do” That will stop them from doing it. ” Elephants going, “And you’re gonna stay there!” “Can we have our ball back, please?” So he did, and Hannibal said, “Well, all right, you proved it with that small film there” You’ve let me into it with that small elephant ski” Are you sure it’s a good idea? “Oh, yes! If you’ve never seen an elephant ski, then you’ve never been on acid”” “Too true, as the old film shows. Right! Elephants for all my men.” “What size do you take?” “Six and a half, thanks.” “All right, you guys better be good at skiing.” Huge ski sticks. And the ski lifts back in those days were enormous! I don’t know if you’ve seen” The Carthaginians are sitting in those bucket seats, with two elephants hanging off their feet The Carthaginians are going, “Oh, my thighs!” The whole military thing is very organized; it’s a very tight regime. You need to have a military, I think, because it’s very hip to say, “Oh, all military should disband!” but you keep getting organized shitheads that wanna kill people come along, like Hitler. If it’s just a shithead, that’s fine; but if it’s an organized shithead, people go” And that’s the problem. Every army has rules; there are no casual armies that go, “Oh, “ello, General!” “Oh, “ello, Corporal.” It’s all, “Yes, Sir! No, Sir! Yes, Sir!” And there’s all these different salutes. You’ve got the British one, the American one, the French one, and countries in Eastern Europe, new countries, going, “Well, we can’t use that one, and that one”s been” What about this one? “Almost a surrender kind of thing”” “Well, there’s that one” or this one” or this one we quite like”” “Go for that one.” “Afternoon, General.” “Afternoon, Corporal.” It’s not very efficient either, that” What about that? That’s much more efficient, sure. Civilians, we have a hand-shaky kind of agreement kind of greeting thing. And people sometimes say to you, “Oh, come here! I want you to meet a whole bunch of people.” Suddenly, you’re meeting eight people all at once, and they all tell you their names. “Hi, my name is Steve.” “Steve, hi.” “My name is Jennifer.” “Jennifer. Bernard”” At the end, you go, “Good to meet you all. I didn’t hear a thing! They’re all over here, aren’t they?” And some people do those squeezy handshakes; that crusher handshake, you know, the “SmallDickI’veGotABigHandshake” kind of… The Compensation Handshake. A firm handshake is great, but that crusher one… where they start to rotate your knuckles, you know? You’re going, “Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you”” And they go into this, and you don’t react, you just go” “Jesus Christ!” We should react” because they’re gonna get away with this, they just keep doing this stupid crusher handshake; they think it’s very… “Ooh-I-have-an-enormous-penis!” handshake, but we know it’s a small dick handshake. And you should react; if someone starts crushing the life out of your hand, just go, “AAAAAAAAH! Hope you die in a car crash!” Either that, or the complete opposite, and just collapse on the floor. You killed him dead, man! Now he suffers from handsqueezy death. Yeah, you killed him” I’m gonna tell on you!” The other type of handshake is that sort of “sock in a cart”… handshake you just receive, you know? “Oh” I don’t know, 2 kilograms, 2.5 kilograms, what do you think?” You should always have a fish up your sleeve for that one, someone gives you that kind of dropin handshake, then you just slap in the fish” “Hey, your hand”s come off! Oh, it’s a fish”” “Yes, a present from my country! Done in one! Done in one! Done in one! ” Then it’s the cool handshake, the street handshake, which is there, and then there, there and there” and” sometimes and bits after it, you know? You can’t ask how it’s done, you just have to know it, that’s what cool is all about. You just know” and you don’t actually just know, “cause no one knows, so you have to watch it” And you go home and practice furiously on five bananas” until the thumb comes off. “Cool” is a pursuit of youth, it’s a fashion link thing being cool. It’s linked to the circle you’ve got “Looking Like a Dickhead” over here, “Average Looking,” “Kind of Cool,” “Cool,” “Hip and Groovy”” “Looking Like a Dickhead”! I have been known to cruise in that back area” I can walk down the street and get these opposite reactions now. I can walk down, and people go, Makes you feel really good, but sick” And yeah, so” There was a look back in the “50s… that was a matchstick out of the corner of your mouth, in the sort of James Dean kind of era, and it was considered quite cool. It’s quite timeless as well, it just works, I don’t know quite why; you lean up against a wall, and you have it there, and you roll it around, and occasionally you pull it out and go, “Hey, you, kids! You kids be cool”” “What a wanker! Who is he? He”s eating a match!” “Yes, I am”” It’s the urban equivalent of the country, kind of yokel character, with the ear of corn out of his mouth, going, “Hey, you, kids! Never suck the juice out of a tractor.” “What’s that?” The tractor going… All the juice sucked out of it. How do you mime a tractor that’s had all the juice sucked out of it? That’s my one” Anyway” Just a thumbnail sketch. So” Oh, yes! I just forgot what I was talking about. So one matchstick out of the corner of your mouth, mmhmmhmm, quite cool. Second matchstick out the other side of the mouth, and you’re looking like a dickhead! You’re right” A third one in the front, looks like your teeth are sliding out” Eye patches have a similar number problem. One eye patch, looking quite cool! Two eye patches” hello? Three eye patches-now what’s going on here? Pirates and the kid at school with the lazy eye, they were the two groups that had eye patches; again, very disparate. I don’t know how you do subsets with them, but anyway” And the lazyeye syndrome, you have one eager beaver eye, that goes, “Oh, look at that! Oh! Oh!” and the other eye is going, “Hey, I’m in bed! I’m in bed! Chill out, man!” “You’re missing the best part of the day.” “Oh, fuck off!” So you put the eye patch over your lazy eye, so it can have a snooze, yeah? Long John Silver had an eye patch, quite cool. Also had a parrot on his shoulder” It was the wrong bird, he should have had a mina bird! “Cause parrots, they suffer from the beautiful plumage, “cause they’ve got greens, and yellows and reds real vibrant colours that really kick out, and you go, “Ooh, wow!” but they look great and talk shite. Squawk! Pieces of eight, “ello!” A bird that says “pieces of eight” is equivalent to having a bird on your shoulder, going, “”4.53! “4.53!” “Shut up, bird, shut up. Don’t say that!” “”4.53!” “Shut up! Stop talking prices!” Yeah, stuff them! Mina birds are much better; they’ve got slick black feathers, and they sit on your shoulder, and they say things like, “Oh, look at that sunset!” If you ever see them in a pet shop, they want to get out of the pet shop; they hate being cooped up in there, they say things “cause they’re bored. People come up, and they say, “Ooh! Nice shoes” I like your haircut, you know? I think you’re sexy!” “That’s a nice bird! Can I buy it?” But be careful, when you take the mina birds home, they don’t like it; they think they’re getting their freedom once they’ve been bought, but you take them into the lounge and they get pissed off, they get sullen” You’ve got people around, and they go, “Oh, they hate you!” “What was that, mina bird?” “You heard me” They hate you! They put poison in your coffee. There’s a pig under the table with a gun. I control them through this cuttlefish here”” “Cause birds fly and we have airplanes, that’s the deal; but no one”s put a flying bird, a bird that can fly, into an airplane. It”d be amazing, because it wouldn’t be flying, but it”d be flying! A mina bird in a 747″ The birds outside” These birds are flying very fast, of course! “Shit!” Oh, I’m not flying, I’m sitting! White wine, please.” They’re hanging on to the side! “I haven”t got fingers, could you cut this up, please? Thank you very much.” We have a fascination with flying, hanggliding is the closest we’ve got. There’s a cliff near where I used to go to school, in Beachy Head, and it’s a big, chocolate, 300400 foot, maybe a mile high, who knows? We certainly don’t, “cause we have no idea. Well, we’re metric now, so 30 cubic litres high, all right? And the road goes very close, if you go to Beachy Head, and people get out of the cars and they just want to look over the cliff. We want to look into the jaws of death, we have that thing; and when you get close to the edge, your brain goes” And if there’s two of you there, you go” “Get out there!” What is all that about? You can’t chuck each other off! You know, whoever you’re going out with ” “Come on!” And everyone does a lot of “waitonthebackfoot” type walking as well, in case there’s a big crack, and everyone goes” And you just go lift and stand back” They old Playtex twostep lift and stand back. And it’s pointless, jumpingit would be interesting up to a point to jump off a cliff, up to” Up to that point” After that, “Oh, no, no, no!” At the bottom, on the jaggy rocks, and there, a lot of crabs and seaweed going, “”Ol”!” “”Si”or!” All the time I was doing that, I was thinking of a Spanish word to say at the end of it” came out a bit weird, didn’t it? Should have been “”Se”or!” not “”Si”or!” That just sounds like a brand of fucking cigarettes” from the “40s or something. God! Weird analogy” Anyway… Even now” Oh, fuck it! Now wizards” well, a bit of a jump there, but they can fly, can’t they?They can fucking fly! They can fucking do anything, because they have the big staff, the big, sort of Gandalf kind of like” “I’ll turn you into a pig!” kind of thing. And when shit’s happening, it’s great to be a wizard, “I’ll turn you into a pig!” We can’t do that, but the closest we’ve got to it, it’s the TV control, when you’re in your flat, on your own, you can go, “2! I’ll have a bit of 3, thank you. 2. 3. 2. 3. 1!” In North America, they’re going, “78! 87! 54!” We’re going, “4! Volume, volume, volume, mute” fast forward, rewind”” And then the “pause” button you press “Pause,” and when I press the pause on a video, I want it to pause” But you press it, and everyone in the film goes” Surely, that button should say “La Cucaracha.” We”d love a “La Cucaracha” button, you”d go, “La Cucaracha! I’m gonna make a toffee”” A coffee, that is, not a toffee. Switch it off, I’m gonna make a toffee, that’s a fucking hour! The coffee is the better one, I don’t know” fuck it. Ah, yes” But I talk about television, I know television, I’m a child of the television age… all the gadgets as well; I like those, but if you lose the control, we just sit there, going, “uh-hh”” “Switch the telly on.” “No, I’ve lost the control! We can’t even switch it on by hand, the television is smooth”” In the old days, you’d say, “Change the channel!” “No, you change it!” “Change the channel!” Eventually, the mouse is going, “Oh, it’s not in the plan I had! I’ll change the channel, fucking”” and the button was really long in the “70s, or that turny one “BBC1″ BBC2″ oh, it’s come off!” And after a while, the batteries start to go. “2. 2. 2! 2! 2!” And when this happens, you take the back off, you put your hand up against the batteries, and you roll them up and down” Yeah! That gives you an extra two days on batteries! Two days before the long walk down to the petrol station to queue with the murderers” La Cucaracha. Yeah” Wizards never have that problem, do they, with their magic staff. “I turn you into a pig. A pi” Oh, I’m a pig now! “Pig! Frog! Pig! Frog! Pig! Bloody batteries! Pig! Frog! Louder Pig! Louder pig! Mute pig! La Cucaracha The Pig!” Television I’m addicted to television, I’m actually watching less of it now, “cause at 4:00 in the morning, I’m going, “I must watch the” Maybe it’s important” Beavers do what? Oh, dams! They build dams! Okay. If I ever meet one, I’ll say, “Build a dam, beaver!”” But quiz shows are something I’ve never really got into; quiz shows like “Come On!”, you know Well, officially, I’m not into them, they come on, I go, “God damn it! God, I don’t like this” Jesus! A quiz” How would somebody quiz” Venice! Fuck, I knew it was a “V” town!” The big mainstream quiz games, like, you know, 8:00 o”clock on some evening, anyone watches anything. “Hey, it’s 8:00 o”clock, it’s “Who Gives a Shit?” You don’t even know what you’re watching, and I’m Charlie Smiles, and here it is, it’s “Who Gives A Shit?” Two teams of five! Steve, tell us a bit about yourself!” “Well, I” “That’s great, Steve!” “And something happened to you when you were 2.” “I was shot dead by a duck” wearing Blakeys.” “Sounds good, Steve. This game is very, very simple and very similar to all the other games in the world. You’re gonna pick three things out of a hat, put them together into a small bag. If you choose the things off the conveyor belt, put your headphones on, go into the booth, listen to some music, come back out, act out a scene from “Othello,” make a pie out of pastry, act out another scene, sing a song, and then, if you do that, you win a sausage. Do you wanna do that?” “Sorry?” “Okay, you don’t go home emptyhanded, “cause we’re gonna cut your hands off!” “Do you want to see what you would have won? Do you want to see what you would have won? You would have been president of the world! 3 billion people as your slaves! Instead, you’re gonna spend your entire life living in a ditch” with poo on your head!” “Oh, thank you very much.” I’ve invented my own quiz game, for late nights, sort of Channel 4, when everyone”s blasted out of their brains, and it’s called “Whose Pig Is This?” Right? That’s what it’s called, and it’s got a mainstream presenter, who just comes out” And these pigs keep getting sent out, and he goes, “Eh, whose pig is this?” The audience is laughing, and he doesn’t know! There’s a pig in the studio! There’s a pig here! Can you get this pig the fuck out of here? Sorry about that, there’s a pig”” Everyone laughing, “Right. Whose pig is this now?” It goes on for about two hours, and 400 pigs are pushed on. Needs a bit of work, doesn’t it? But it’s basically there, the pig motif” But I am a gadget nut, I’m a real-you’ve heard of techno-fear? Well, there’s techno-fear and techno-joy, and techno-fear are people on computers, going, “No” I don’t” It’ll wipe it” No” How…” And techno-joy are people “I know how to do this! It’s” Oh, I’ve wiped it! Oh, it” doesn’t hit it with a hammer! ” That’s me, “hit it with a”” You’re just getting something new, and you get this big tome to read through, and you go, “Oh, it’s so powerful! Oh, fuck”” And then you just set fire to it all, and run around in your knickers for a bit” But I am into gadgets; I was always fascinated by James Bond’s gadgets, “cause he had these brilliant little gadgets, but the guy who gave them to him, “Q,” he must have been some sort of psychic, “cause they always gave him exactly what he would have want of, very lean, wasn’t it? He used every single item, he never came back, going, “Q, I’ve got a lot of stuff I didn’t use on that adventure. Went all the way out to fucking God knows where, and this watch that turned into a hamster, what was the point of that? These trousers, press a button, turn into jam. Why? The hat turned into a bicycle, that was very funny”” It was! He’d fall into the water, there were sharks there, he had a breathing apparatus; he could breathe up to four minutes. He never went, “Shit! It’s in the hotel! I’ve got the trousers that turn into jam, though”” The shark”s going, “Oh, there’s blood everywhere! Look, it’s bloIt’s jam! Oh, I’ve got water in me nose!” Anyway” Do they do that? Do they go” You see a shark coming to the surface” “Oh, it went down the wrong way” I swallowed some oxygen”” Anyway” Yeah” So he did, he had preciselywhen James Bond got into the Aston Martin, with the ejector seat, the baddie sat in the fucking ejector seat! He never sat in the back” James going, “You couldn’t sit in the front, could you?” “No, Mr. Bond, I will sit in the back. I will sit in the back seat. I have a gun on you, I’m a S”mores agent and you can go nowhere.” “You couldn’t come and sit up here in the front, could you? It’s a nice seat here” I like the company.” “No, I will not, Mr. Bond. I’ll sit in the back here.” “Where exactly are you from, by the way?” “Don’t you take the piss out of me! I will come up in the front and talk to you” Why don’t you” I am a S”mores agent, I have a voice synthesizer in my throat. I can do any accent you can think of. Unfortunately, I’ve lost the instructions, it seems, and my voice box is stuck on “shop demonstration,” which is a bit of a bummer”” “You’re a fucking nutter you are! Still, he”s in the ejector seat now, I’ll press” Oh, shit! I’m not in the Aston Martin! I’m in a fucking Mini! Nice car, but no fucking ejector seat. Even the windows are those half ones”” “Bugger!” He never did that, did he, James Bond? He never went” That was more Muttley, wasn’t it? “My name is Bond, James Bond.” That wouldn’t be cool enough for him. “You think you’ve got me, Blowfelt? Well, you haven”t!” “My name is not Blowfelt, I am a S”mores agent, man.” “Right” Oh, I’ve got a breathing apparatus! I know what to do.” “What are you doing, Mr. Bond?” “I can breathe for four minutes with this, and you can’t!” “I think I can”” “Can you? Oh, bum!” “You don’t have a shark, do you, by any chance? “Cause they quite like jam, you know”” Yeah” I watch a lot of educational stuff on telly as well, and I think it’s great, “cause you can just watch it and then fuck off; you can go, “Really? Oh, really? Oh, really?” That’s a great way to be a student-if you could have had lessons when you were at school, going, “Oh, really? No, I didn’t know that” Oh, that’s the bell! Bye!” Trouble is, the teachers would say, “Now write that out four times, and then I’m gonna test you tomorrow on stuff I’ve not told you about.” I did Physics, for some reason, I didn’t want to do Physics at Alevel, but I did it, and… I was quite interested in the space stuff, String Theory, Stephen Hawkings, Einstein”s Theory of Relativitydidn’t understand what the hell it was all about” It was great, you come up with a theory that you only can test if you go into a black hole with a ruler. “Oh, really?” “Oh, I got sucked in!” There must be 1 or 2 people in blackholes, going, “Hello? Have you got a ladder?” You’d need quite big forearms to pull yourself out of a black hole” Sorry, that’s a density joke” No, it’s a gravity joke, no density joke” Fuck it! Anyway” So” Yeah, Einstein came up with the Theory of Relativity, “E=mc2.” Energy equals the mass, the weight, times the speed of light squared, and the annoying thing is it’s so bloody precise, it’s so it’s just there! And he went, “E=mc2. It works! I’m off for a sandwich now!” “I’m going to America to plug my head into the main”” “Now I’m going skiing with my elephant friends! Snowplough!” “Fuck off my roof! Stop skiing off my roof!” “Fucking nuclear physicists! Sorry about that, Mrs. Badcrumble! Anyway, tell us that joke again about the three banjo players”” Yeah” So anyway, he did, he came up with “E=mc2,” and there must”ve been some physicist at the time, going, “E=mc2? I had F=mc2! So close!” “F” for fudge. “Fudge equals the mass times the speed of light squared.” But we used to do experiments, where you tested it. “We decided to test the Theory of Relativity. Jeff got a torch” and stood on this side of the room. Now Jeff, switch the torch on and shout “”go,” and I will time how long it takes to see the light and the speed” Hold on, if you say “go,” that’s speed of sound, and I would hear that after I’ve seen the light, so say “go” slightly earlier” and you time how early you’ve” Oh, it’s a million miles an hour! I said a million billion” no one can tell! No one can run that fast! And mass” can you weigh the torch for the mass, please? Can you weigh it in a vacuum? Can you weigh it near a vacuum, then? You can weigh it near a vacuum cleaner, that’s great! 4.5 fluid ounces” And that is the energy… in cat’s pi squared ironing board” And so where are the batteries? Wallop, wallop, wallop”” Then you write it all in a project, and you put water on it, dry it off with a hairdryer and give it in. “It’s kind of blurry”” “Oh, it was the rain!” Finally tonight, I want to talk about a guy called Pavlov, who was Eastern European, I think Russian, and did the famous experiment, “Pavlov”s Dog.” You probably heard of, ring bells and dogs eating food, response times, Pavlovian kind of response, it’s all about icecream and” And he wrote these experiments. “Day One ” Pavlov’s Dog ” Rang bell, dog ate food, very excited”” He’s become Welsh! “Very excited” terribly excited here in… Russia. Day two “been well-accepted here in Russia, changed my name from Evans to Pavlov. I’m now called Gareth Pavlov” and fitting in well. Day two ” rang bell, dog ate two loads of food, very excited. Day Three ” rang three bells, dog ate a whole bunch of food… and my leg, too. Very excited, win Nobel Dog Prize for cats.” So he did this, he won the prize” Nobel, whatever he won, and Pavlov”s dog, we all know that, but you never heard his cat results, did you? You probably thought he was finished! “Pavlov”s Cat Results ” Day One ” rang bell” cat fucked off. Damn” Day Two ” rang bell, cat went and answered dog. Day Three ” rang bell, cat said he”d eaten earlier. Day Four ” went to ring bell on day four, but cat had stolen batteries. Final day ” Day Five ” went to ring bell with new batteries, but cat put his paw on bell, so it only made a “thunk!” noise. Then cat rang his own bell! I ate food”” I’m just gonna finish up by talking about the beginning of time. Very quick piece, very quick! Beginning of time the Big Bang, right? Everyone stood well back” “What? Oh, okay” Well, how big? Very big. All right” Stand back, Mrs. Badcrumble. Come on, Cesar; come on, Australian man” Come on, Welsh Pavlov” ” “Oh, thank you.” “Never go back to the universe once it’s been made, come on”” Suddenly, BOOM! They all went, “Fucking “ell!” And it was made, the whole universe exploded out in perfect circular bits that became planets later, which was very lucky, and later on all the planets are gonna go all the way back to the middle and crash back in when the gravity gives out, and when it goes back in, I want to be on top of the world, holding on to big reins, going, “Come on! Come on! Come on!” Anyway” But later on, the Earth cooled, and Mother Nature revealed itself to the world one day. She said, “Creatures of the world! Gather “round, I shall give you your methods of procreation.” All the creatures going, “Oh, cheers, Mother Nature! I’ve been dying for a shag, me!” “All right, gather round” Here”s a big clipboard here, big flipchart! Ccheese” Minis” anyone knows what this is? Glue factory” anyone? Glue factory? How you doing, dogs?” “Okay, now dogs” we have got you down, dogs” your method of procreation will be doggy fashion! How about that?” “Yeah, we invented it!” “I know you did! And it’s caught on big time! Okay, off you go”” “Be careful with the air lock!” “Now, cats”” “Cats, good to meet you. Now, we’ve got you down for doggy fashion! How about that?” “What about catty fashion?” “No, sorry, dogs got in there first; it’s a “patent pending” situation” Anyway, you’ve got cat flaps, so what the fuck are you arguing about?” “Now” Pavlov, what are you doing here?” “Well, I’ve been trying to do things and” banjo”” “Ooh, I’m hungry now!” “Next we have” sheep! Good haircut, by the way” We’ve got you down for doggy fashion! If you get hot, just take your coats off, right?” “Okay” You wearing Blakeys?” “Mouse, what are you doing here?” “Well, I’ve got a space rocket out of jam” It won’t work, but” it’s not my best laid plan. I could go aglay” but Mrs. Badcrumble is coming, and Cesar, and the Australian guy” And we could burn up on reentry, or become a sort of” thing.” “Well, think of a joke for the end of that line, anyway” Off you go” “Now giraffes! Good to see you. We’ve got you down for doggy fashion, but it’s whatever you can work out, basically. Hang off a lamppost, lean over a tree, you know” just swing about a bit; I mean, sorry, we were gonna make you like a Spaniel kind of size, but someone brought me a coffee and vooom! when I was doing design work, and there you go” Anyway, chin up! All right” “Human beings” Well, doggy fashion, catty fashion, giraffe fashion, sheep fashion; whatever the hell you want, basically” Hang upside down like a bat, play the banjo, do it on a golf course! As long as you get guilt in there somewhere, we really don’t mind” “Now finally, salmon! Good” Got a bit of a surprise for you, people” What you’re gonna do is to swim upstream against a… downflowing river until you come to a huge waterfall”” “”and you’re going to leap, and leap, and leap, and leap up this waterfall, and you swim along, and you leap, and leap, and leap, and leap; then you get along, and you lay eggs, and you fertilize the eggs, and then you drop down dead! Ha!” “We’re quite happy with doggy fashion”” “No” You piss me off, you salmon! You’re too expensive in restaurants, that’s your trouble”” And there’s a moral to this story. Or at least there was supposed to be a moral, but because I’m dyslexic, it is, in fact, a marble. Thank you, good night.

    "transcript":"Comedy Central Stand-UpPublished date:March 24, 2023 Greer Barnestalks about smoking weed, the plight of the bees and wanting to meet aliens. Announcer: From New York City,Comedy Central PresentsGreer Barnes![Cheers, whistles & applause] Thank you. Wow, that—that was nice.[Laughter] How y’all doing?[Silence] What, y’all is good?What happened?[Laughter] So anyway, I was in the park last night chasing this white guy.[Laughter] And he—You guys aren’t too fast, but you run a really long time.Woo![Laughter continues] I would have had to have been Kenyan to catch this cat.[Laughter and applause] Running right next to him.[Panting] Jamaican accent: “What-type-of-shoes-are-those?”[Laughter and applause][Panting]“’Cause these rocks are hurting my feet.”[Laughter continues] So, I smoke marijuana sometimes—a lot—every day.[Cheers and applause] And I’ll tell you, I really don’t see the downside to marijuana. Doctors say [bleep] like, Deep voice: “Well, if you smoke marijuana, it’s known to cause you to forget things.” Maybe some of us got some [bleep] we need to forget.[Laughter and applause] “Marijuana is also known to increase your appetite.” You mean, the munchies? Oooh. Like brothers are smoking joints, getting the munchies, and going out trying to stick up Keebler Elf houses or some [bleep].[Laughter] See a bunch of brothers in the park harassing trees.[Knock, knock, knock] “Yo, I know you in there, little elf man. Just tell us which tree y’all make the cookies in.”[Laughter, cheers & applause] “Go check them other trees.”[Cheers and applause][Laughter] I took the train down here earlier tonight, and you know how they can just randomly search you?So, I have my knapsack on. And I’m high. So, you know, I was a little nervous.And this officer is like, “Excuse me, sir, may I see your knapsack, please?”You know whenever I get nervous, I try to be funny. Sometimes, it don’t work out.[Laughter] So this officer is like, “Excuse me, man, can I see your knapsack?” So I took my knapsack off and I went like this—[Laughter and applause] He didn’t like that.[Laughter, whistles & applause] And then you get on the train and you hear that ridiculous, “This is a message from the MTA. Be on the lookout for suspicious-looking packages and\/or activities. If you see something, don’t do anything. Tell someone, like a police officer or an MTA employee.”Really… an MTA employee?[Laughter] You mean like that brother over there messing with the trash? Him?[Laughter and applause] Okay.[Tapping sound]“Hey, man, there’s a suspicious-looking package over there.”[Laughter continues] “Yeah, I know, I saw it.”[Laughter and applause] “Go talk to that lady in the booth.”[Tapping sound]“Hey, lady in the booth, there’s a suspicious-looking package over there.”[Muffled dialogue][Laughter and applause] “Be on the lookout for suspicious-looking activities.” I live on 144th Street and 8th Avenue, Harlem, okay? I see a lot of stuff that could be considered suspicious-looking. Like yesterday I walked outside of my building and I saw two brothers on the sidewalk playing ping pong… Now that’s a suspicious-looking activity.[Laughter and applause] Where the hell did they get that ping pong table from?[Laughter continues] I’ve gotta alert the authorities. “Hello, officer.” “Yeah.”“I see two brothers on the sidewalk playing ping pong.”“Let me get this right—you see two brothers on the sidewalk playing ping pong?”“Uh-huh.”[Laughter] “We’ll send a squad car right away.”[Imitating hitting ping pong ball][Cheers and applause] I actually saw a group of cops on horses last night—like six of them—just walking toward a brother.[Hoof beats approaching] My first thought was: plantation. I don’t know why.[Laughter] I was expecting one of them to say something to me, “Where you goin’, boy?”[Spits tobacco into spittoon][Laughter] So I could just look at him, “Nowhere, sir. Mr. Lincoln says I’s free.”[Laughter, cheers & applause] Hey fellas, your girlfriend ever ask you a question that just make you go, “What?”[Laughter] A couple of nights ago, I’m in bed with my girlfriend. We just got through—finished—having sex. We’re sweatin’ ’cause we don’t have no air conditioner.[Laughter and applause] And we’re sitting there smoking a joint, and she looks at me and she goes,Jamaican accent: “Baby, what would you do, right, if we woke up tomorrow and I had your penis and you had my vagina?”[Laughter and applause] Inhales — “What?” — exhales[Laughter and applause] “What would you do?”“I wouldn’t let you screw me.”[Laughter and applause] One time my girlfriend asked me, she was like, “Baby, if your penis could talk, right, what would it say?”“What?”“What would it say?”[Heavy sigh] I’m gonna take this opportunity to speak on behalf of all men on this mud bowl we call Earth. If our penis could talk, it would probably say something like, Raspy voice: “Touch me.” That’s it. That’s it.[Laughter, cheers & applause] Regular voice: “I’m going outside to get some cake.”Raspy voice: “Touch me. Touch me with the cake.”[Laughter and applause] If the vagina could talk, you know what it would say?[Inhales deeply][Talking rapidly]“We’ve been in this relationship for three and a half years…”Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.[Laughter, cheers & applause] Wow, you guys are fun, man. Right on.[Cheers, whistles & applause] So, I sit home a lot and I watch nature shows. That’s what I do. I smoke weed and I watch nature shows, you know? And I was watching one episode, they were talking about “the bees.” Now the plight that the bees are going through on the planet right now is like really serious [bleep]—excuse my French. Like, these bees are dying by the hundreds of thousands all over the world. And then this narrator said that if all the bees on the planet died, that the birds would be next—and then us. And I’m sitting there with my boy and I’m like, “We gotta save the bees.”[Laughter and applause] Husky voice: “I feel you, my dude. ’Cause I like honey in my tea, you feel me?”[Laughter] Then the narrator went on to say,[Stuffy voice]“The European bee is a much more kinder, gentler bee, as opposed to the Africanized bee, which is a much more aggressive, hostile bee.” Really? You just gonna try to sneak racism into the bug world?[Laughter and applause] Like European bees are just floating around like, “Bzzzzz.”[Fancy accent]“So, what are we going to do today?”“Bzzzz.”[French accent]“I don’t know, maybe we can pollinate that flower.”“Bzzzzz. Look at the sun, yes, I love it.”[Laughter, cheers & applause] Like the African bee is in his beehive like, “Who the [bleep] are we going to sting today?”[Laughter and applause] And, you know, I don’t know how I come up with this stuff sometimes. Like—I think crazy stuff, you know what I mean? Like, okay—on my way down here, I said to myself that I wish I could fly. And then I thought about it, and I was like, “If I could fly, I’d probably get arrested.” You know what I mean? Like, I’d be flying along somewhere, and somebody would be,“Is that a [bleep] flying?”[Laughter]“Hello, officer? Yeah, I just saw a Black guy fly by my window. Um, no, he didn’t have a basketball. He seemed…”[Laughter and applause] I wanted to be an astronaut when I was younger. And then I just was like, “Hey, it’s cheaper to smoke weed. You still get to space.”“I still get to space, baby.”[Chuckles][Laughter] I always wanted to be the first man to make contact with another alien race, you know what I mean?Land on their planet, walk up to ’em—“Yo, my dude? What’s good?”[Laughter][Alien speech]“Oh no, I’m human, from the planet Earth. See that blue ball way out there? Yeah, that’s where I’m from.”[Alien speech]“Nah, we ain’t got no dream people, but it’s cool.”[Laughter][Alien speech]“Well, we’ll probably call you [bleep] at first, but—”[Laughter and applause] I was in Australia, went scuba diving.See, some of y’all looking at me like, “Bullshit, brothers don’t swim.” But hear me out. I don’t know how to swim, and my dive master was like,[Australian accent]“Don’t worry about it, you’ll be fine.”[Laughter and applause] [Scared voice]“Okay.” We hopped on this boat and went so far out that we couldn’t even see the shoreline anymore. Boat comes to a stop. Start getting dressed—putting on our lead weight belt and flippers and goggles and air tank, checking the line.Cah, cah, cah—psssh—in the water. Can’t talk underwater, so you gotta learn all these signals, like:“Let’s go up.” “Let’s go down.” “Stop.”“[Bleep] ain’t too cool.”[Laughter and applause] I’m paraphrasing.[Laughs] “I’m okay.” “Out of air.” “Low on air.”“Wet suit too tight, you gotta fix that. You gotta get it out your butt.”♪ Don’t want no wet suit in the butt, you gotta take ♪“Shark.” That’s important. You see this—and none of this.It’s just [bleep] outta here. That’s it. That’s it.Let’s like [bleep]—let’s—let’s get the—let’s do it, no more of that [bleep].[Cheers and applause] It was interesting, scuba diving. I remember the first fish I saw.I could have sworn he took a double take at me, like,“What the [bleep]?”[Fish sounds][Laughter]“Is that a brother?”[Laughter and applause] It was cool scuba diving—till my dive master led me to a cave fifty feet underwater.We’re floating outside this cave, and he looks over at me and he’s like,[Underwater sounds][Underwater sounds continue][Laughter][Applause][Shooting noises][Laughter, cheers & applause] I got on the train earlier tonight, and these young Black kids were looking at me, and I overheard them saying,“Look at my man, got on sandals.”[Laughter][Laughing hysterically]I swear, man. I’m sittin’ there, I’m trying to cover up my toes.[Laughter and applause] I’m a grown-ass man.[Laughing hysterically] Then this old Jamaican dude walked on with a little moustache like this, and I overheard the kid,“Look at this motherfucker here, got the Adolph.” And that old Jamaican man looked at him and said,[Jamaican accent]“Wha-ya say? This no Adolph, boy. Me no goose step. Me no goose step. Me a big fan of Charlie Chaplin. Me an’ here, see? Been here.”[Laughter and applause] That is such a stupid joke.[Laughter and applause continues] Wish I had one of them cool European accents. ’Cause that’s how you get the chicks—you could walk up to them and say anything. [French accent]“Tell me something. What type of panties are you wearing?”[Laughter and applause] [Snobby voice]“Get away from me.”[French accent]“Tell me.”[Snobby voice]“They’re blue.”[Laughter and applause] [French accent]“I like that. Take them off.”[Laughter][Snobby voice]“Get away from me.”[French accent]“Off.”[Laughter and applause] [Shy voice]“I can’t believe I’m doing this.”[Laughter and applause] Gotta have one of them cool European accents. You can’t be American. “Hey girl, what kind of drawers you got on?”[Siren sounding]“Against the wall—sexual harassment, this guy.”[Laughter, cheers & applause] Hey man, I think that’s my time.

    "transcript":"Jim Gaffigan: Live from Old Forester – The Bourbon Set (2025) Release date:November 23, 2025 (YouTube) Jim Gaffigan’s Live from Old Forester – The Bourbon Set is a 45-minute stand-up special built entirely around bourbon, whiskey culture, and the absurdities of drinking. He opens by admitting no one asked for a bourbon-themed show, framing the whole set as the product of his own obsession. From riffs on being “mentally ill” enough to talk about bourbon nonstop to poking fun at drinkers who jump on and off the proverbial wagon, Gaffigan leans into the contradictions of alcohol culture: it loosens you up while ruining careers and families, it’s marketed responsibly while fast-food chains never warn you about fries, and it comes packaged in myths that are half tradition, half marketing fiction. He skewers bourbon experts, American patriotism via corn mash, and the odd sibling rivalry between bourbon, rye, and Tennessee whiskey. A long story about Jerry Seinfeld accidentally buying him $500 pours of King of Kentucky becomes a centerpiece, illustrating how drinking culture blends fantasy, status, and denial. Gaffigan also mocks celebrity spirits, outlandish bourbon marketing (aging at sea, barrels listening to Metallica), and collectors who watch YouTube bottle hunts. The set closes with broader jokes about liquor stores, flavored whiskey, airport drinking, and the ridiculous rituals people invent to justify their alcohol habits. Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Gaffigan! You may be wondering, why do an entire show about bourbon? Well, let me tell you, no one asked for it. No one came up to me and like, “When are you going to do a standup set about America’s Native Spirit?” I’m mentally ill. So, I’d like you to keep that in mind. I’m going to be talking about bourbon for 30 minutes straight. All right? Which is essentially what bourbon drinkers do a couple times a day. All right? Most of these jokes are going to be about bourbon and whiskey. If you’re looking for a brandy or a tequila joke, that’s another comedian processing a different form of denial. Here’s how we landed here. During the pandemic, I got really into gardening and bourbon. And what I learned over the past couple years is no one cares about gardening… So, here we are. Ideally, you should be 21 to hear these jokes, but in a perfect world, we’d all be 21 forever. But life doesn’t work like that, which is why Jesus invented bourbon, right? Uh, I assume some of you don’t drink or maybe you no longer drink. That’s a chapter of your life you put behind you. I guess what I’m trying to say is… “come on back! You proved your point. Get off the wagon. Wagons are for children!” I never understood that. On the wagon, off the wagon. “Why do these drunks keep getting on and off my wagon?” All I know is if you’re still traveling by wagon, you deserve a drink. If your view is a horse’s ass, you need something to take the edge off. For the record, I would never encourage anyone to drink alcohol… unless they want to have fun. Alcohol can be fun. It can loosen you up. You lose your inhibitions and sometimes your career and family. The great irony is when I met my wife, I didn’t drink at all. My two older children never saw me have a beer until they were in high school. And now I have my own bourbon. I would never say my kids are the reason I drink, but they are why I get drunk. It is weird how adults talk to children about alcohol. Like, we’re never honest. It’s like, “Daddy, why do you drink?” Well, it’s the only thing I like about being alive. Here’s looking at you, kid. I’m kidding. Kind of… But I will occasionally have a bourbon every night. I don’t drink bourbon every day. That would be ridiculous. It-It’s just at night. But I only have two bourbons, just two. And after that, I lose count. “Cuz I like a high proof with a heavy bore.” Now, I’m not a bourbon expert, but I’m annoying in other ways… And I’m not trying to say all bourbon experts are annoying, but if you’re annoying, you probably know a lot about bourbon. But I get it. I get it. Bourbon is interesting. Bourbon is a uniquely American whiskey, right? To be called bourbon, it must be made in the United States with 51% corn and consumed by a man who’s out of shape. In a way, I’m being patriotic. That’s why I don’t drink vodka. I’m not a communist. Now, if you talk about bourbon, you have to include rye, right? Bourbon and rye, they’re like whiskey roommates, right? They’re genetically similar. If they took a 23 and me, they’d be like, “Oh my god, we’re totally related. If Bourbon and Rye are siblings, then Tennessee Whiskey is Bourbon’s twin brother who changed his name so he could become a country music star.” Now, I like Tennessee whiskey cuz I like bourbon. Tennessee whiskey is just that kid that needed to be told they were special. Right. “I’m different from bourbon, aren’t I, mama?” “Yes, you are. You’re my Lincoln County bundle of joy.” Now, there are whisies from throughout the world, right? There’s Scotch whiskey, there’s Irish whiskey, Canadian, Indian, wherever the English invaded. Those people were like, “We need some damn whiskey.” To be called Scotch whiskey, it must be made in Scotland, but there they just call it whiskey. In fact, in Scotland, Scotch is a derogatory term or a type of tape. Here’s an interesting fact. Scotch whiskey and scotch tape taste the same. “It’s like we’re wrapping Christmas presents.” Whiskey, of course, is part of the spirits industry. It’s called the spirits industry because you’re often haunted by the decisions you make. No. No, I didn’t! I didn’t! As a result, the spirits industry advocates for responsible drinking. They’ll put that in ads. Drink responsibly. No other American industry discourages over consumption. Right? McDonald’s is never like, “Hey, fat ass, take it easy on the fries.” Ben & Jerry’s doesn’t tell people, “Tubby, that pint is not a single serving.” Taco Bell doesn’t print on their rappers, “Enjoy your diarrhea.” And they should. Whiskey is one of the spirits which improves with age, right? That’s why there are names like old forester, old granddad, or old dirty bastard. Age is a positive, right? This doesn’t apply to many of the things we consume. You never hear someone say, “I bought this tuna salad on the day my daughter was born, and when she turns 21, we’re going to crack it open. I’m detecting notes of botulism.” This is usually the point where people go, “Why? Why so many jokes about whiskey?” Well, there’s a reason. My accountant told me if I talk about something in my standup, I can write it off on my taxes. So that’s why I’d like to discuss the following. Give me some time here. Papy 23, President’s Choice, and King of Kentucky. Those are some of my favorite bourbons. And I’m aware even having one favorite bourbon is concerning. And having multiple favorite bourbons is probably a sign that I have a discerning palate. But bourbon drinkers, favorite can have different meanings, right? Favor can be your favorite casual drinking bourbon, your favorite bourbon you use in a mixer, or your favorite bourbon you enjoy when someone else is paying. Right? You know, I was lucky enough I got to co-headline some shows with Jerry Seinfeld. And now, I don’t know if you know, but Jerry Seinfeld is extremely poor. No, Jerry did very well. Jerry doesn’t really drink, but he uh he knows I enjoy bourbon. And after our Charlotte show, Jerry, we were checking into our hotel and there was a bar in the lobby, and Jerry said, “Hey, why don’t we get a drink? You could get a bourbon.” Jerry actually sounds like that. As we walked in the bar, I saw this wall of a hundred bottles. And at the top there was a bottle of King of Kentucky, which is very rare. I had never tried it. Among bourbon nerds, it’s considered a unicorn. It’s impossible to find. And I thought, “Oh, I’d love to get King of Kentucky.” But I realized it would be 75, maybe a hundred bucks a glass. And then I realized, you know what? Jerry Seinfeld can handle that. As we sat down, Jerry said, “Yeah, whatever you want.” And I thought, “Oh, I’m going to.” Jerry got a Courvoisier. I ordered the King of Kentucky. And I saw this waitress climb this this ladder up and grabbed this beautiful bottle and she brought it down and she poured it and she handed it to me and I tasted it and it was pure euphoria. I felt like I was the king of Kentucky, which is ridiculous because we all know that’s Colonel Sanders, right? I then had this epiphany. I should have Jerry Seinfeld try King of Kentucky. Jerry will become a a bourbon drinker because of me. Then we can go out drinking expensive bourbon and Jerry can pay for it. I said, “Jerry, you got to try this.” Jerry tasted it and he said, “I don’t like it. It’s not good, but get another one if you want.” And I thought, “Oh, I’m going to.” So, I got another one. And it was even better. Then the check came and Jerry was looking at it strangely and I said, “Is there a problem?” And Jerry said, “Your king of kuckies cost 500 bucks a pop.” Now, there are a couple things you can do in that situation. I should point out Jerry’s a friend, but more importantly, he’s someone I respect. So, I could have said, “Jerry, that’s ridiculous. Let me pay.” But all I said was, “Sorry, Jerry.” It was like I was in my own personal Seinfeld episode. It’s crazy. That’s a true story. That’s a true story. The only thing I made up is I’ve never met Jerry Santa. No, the only thing I changed is Jerry actually loved King of Kentucky. But I think the story is better when he has to pay for something he didn’t even like. And that’s where comedy is similar to bourbon. The story behind it doesn’t have to be totally true. Like there’s a lot of stories in bourbon and some of them are colorful and some of them are just made up, right? There’s there’s a saying of bourbon is 51% corn and 49% BS. And half of that’s true. Like Elijah Craig, the father of bourbon. The father of bourbon. Is he the father? Let’s just say Mory Povich wasn’t around then. Elijah Craig, you are not the father. Now, some of the bourbon BS is more audacious. There was a time when bourbon and whiskey was sold in the United States as medicine. It was considered medicinal, meaning it had healing properties. And I know there’s probably parents of teenagers that are like, “Jim, bourbon absolutely has healing properties,” but really it comes down to story. Story is intrinsic to bourbon. Right? Many people believe there’s uh in every bottle of bourbon, there’s a story. And as you drink that bottle, that story becomes much more interesting. And when you finish the bottle, you’re like, “What was the story?” And then you have to do it all again. Now, you may be curious who these two men are. They’re my dad’s. No. Whiskey in America has many famous men and women. And these are just two of them, right? This is George Garvin Brown who invented the color brown. For years, people were like, “What is that dark tan?” And he was like, “No, it’s Brown.” No. George Garvin Brown started Brown Foreman with another guy named George Foreman, who was famous for his grill. No. George Garvin Brown in 1870 started a bourbon called Old Forester which is named after Dr. William Forester who was a famous Civil War surgeon and and George wanted a famous doctors to endorse his bourbon. So he got Dr. Forester who by today’s standards would be like Dr. Oz or Dr. Phil, if they were respected… right? Now, some of the stories are just clever marketing, right? There’s a bourbon where all the barrels are aged on a ship at sea. It’s called Jefferson Ocean. Right now, Jefferson has other brands. I should probably say these out loud so I can write them off. There’s Jefferson Reserve, Jefferson Tropics, Jefferson Airplane, which changed its name to Jefferson Starship. They really jumped the shark when they came out with that song. We built this city on source barrels. By the way, if you get any of those jokes, that means you’re old. “Jim, let me enjoy that damn jokes!” I do love Jefferson. There’s another bourbon where all the barrels listen to Metallica. I’m not making that up. The barrels only listen to Metallica when they’re around their friends. When they’re alone, a lot of Boy George, do you really want to… I’m just going to do this the rest of the show… But in both examples, those those two are it’s how the barrels are reacting to the vibrations either from being at sea or responding to the music that will change the taste of the bourbon. Now, this barrel, which is full, by the way, has been exposed to my standup and therefore should taste hilarious. Now, that’s an interesting backstory, right? But we all collectively know it’s also horseshit, which would be a great name for a bourbon. Have you tried Jim Gaffagan’s horseshit? It’s unbelievably smooth. And when you saw the price, you’d be like, “That’s hysterical. The only pro, well, there’s many problems we would have with horseshit bourbon. One of which is the name, but also it would be a celebrity spirit, which I mean, come on, those are the worst. And I understand, I get it why someone would be offended by a celebrity spirit. Who are these interlopers that are coming in having an ego trip in the middle of my industry? Why would a eight-time Grammy nominee, multi-Emmy-winningNew York Timesbest-selling author, why would he want to slum with trash like us? Well, I like you little people. I do love the bourbon industry. It is… it’s, you know, I’ve been just a couple years, but the the welcoming and just there’s this there’s this etiquette and civility that I think America could learn so much from. Like you know when Heaven Hill burnt down, the rest of the bourbon industry stepped right up and said, “Hope you have insurance.” No, they said “you can make your bourbon here.” Which is amazing. It’s amazing. And I just want you to know the generosity that you’ve shown me. And if I ever run into you outside of Kentucky, I just want you to know that I’ll act like I don’t know you. But I do love your bourbon because drinking bourbon makes me feel like a man. I’m not trying to alienate the women here, but fellas, wouldn’t you agree? Bourbon is kind of like ourShania Twainsong. Come on, fellas. Bourbon is the easiest way to feel like a man. Like, you don’t need to fix a car or chop down a tree. You just need to drink bourbon. You just need to go like this. Look at how manly that looks. Bourbon brings men together. Men need that. Women are social. Women, any excuse. You want to get coffee? Let’s get coffee. Men, there needs to be a reason. You want to get coffee? Why? There needs to be an activity. That’s why men go hunting, we go fishing, we go golfing. Do you think those men who play golf, do you think they enjoy golf? They’re not good at it. They don’t even like the guys they’re with. They’re just desperate to get away from their families. But bourbon facilitates a unique manly bonding. Bourbon allows men to gather with other men away from their wives in basement and show each other bottles and and have manly conversations about viscosity and mouth feel and unicorns. And then those men can kiss… …because bourbon is gay. When a guy says he’s really into bourbon, he’s saying “I’m gay.” Just saying… Of course, women love bourbon, too, right? Women love bourbon. You know, we there are brilliant female master distillers, incredible female blenders, and science has proven that women have a better palate than men, right? That’s been proven that that women can pick up the smallest detail and and and harp on it and-and-and refuse to let it I’m talking about bourbon. This is science. No, supposedly women can pick up different details and and bring it up much later on when you thought you’d moved on. They’re like, “No, I’m going to bring it up again.” Okay, now that I’ve alienated half the audience and probably the people who bought the tickets… The whiskey and bourbon does have this male association. Some of it’s historical, some of it’s marketing, some of it’s coincidence, right? Like there’s there’s a rye whiskey called Thomas Handy, which is very expensive. And if if you’re into whiskey, you probably asked yourself, “would I pay $400 for a Handy?” “My wife would kill me. I really want a handy. If she finds out, I could just say, ‘I’m going to give the Handy to a friend.’ “ But that’s not even the weirdest name for a whiskey. There’s a whiskey called Chicken Cock. Chicken Cock. That’s the name, which sounds like an insult a seventh grader would come up with. Oh, yeah. Well, you-you’re a chickencock. I don’t know how they expect us to go into a bar and order that. You know, “I-I-I want a Chicken Cock.” “Buddy, you’re in the wrong bar.” But the brand has that name cuz when it was introduced in the 1800s, people didn’t say rooster. They said hen or chickencock until people were like, “You got to stop saying that.” Some people believe that the rooster or the chicken cock, if you will, is how we came up with the term cocktail. Some people believe the initial cocktail was the drink you would have in the morning after a night of heavy drinking. It was the drink you’d have in the morning that would allow you to cock up your tail and face the day. And I heard that and I was like, how much were these people drinking? I mean, I have two bourbons and I can’t walk the next day. I know that as hair of the dog, right? Hair of the dog, which is the theory that the cure for a hangover from drinking too much alcohol is to drink more alcohol. Now, the fact that everyone in this room knows what I’m talking about and has tried that is why we as a species will be extinct. It’s sad. Bourbon and whiskey, they have… there’s… they have their own lingo, right? You don’t have a glass of bourbon. You have a pore of bourbon. Poor. It’s very caveman. You pour me drink. I like sometimes the bourbon is referred to as juice. How much juice is in the barrel? Is there juice? So if I drink a bottle of bourbon every day for six days straight, technically that’s a juice cleanse, right? At this point, I’m less concerned about the amount of bourbon I drink and more worried about the number of bottles I’ve acquired. I’ve started to collect bourbon, which is got to be a red flag, right? I mean, were there any signs he had a problem? I mean, besides the thousands of bottles, no. But you rationalize, right? You rationalize. You’re like, you know what? People collect different things. Some people collect sneakers, some people collect action figures. In a way, bourbon bottles are like action figures filled with liquor. And similar to action figures, each bourbon has their own personality. It’s like, oh no, Bookers is taking on Wild Turkey. I’m higher proof. I’m older. I have a drinking problem, but it’s going to be okay. Really, I have a bourbon problem. It’s a bourbon obsession. And as I look out in the audience, I see there’s some other men who obviously have a bourbon obsession. Either that or they’ve stopped caring what they look like. There’s a lot of overlap. There is a certain look to a bourbon obsessed guy. Like if you’re over the age of 30, out of shape with a beard, and you don’t drink bourbon, you’re a fraud. That’s called stolen valor… which would be another great name for our bourbon. Have you tried the harsh at Stolen Valor? No. Collecting. If you do collect bourbon, that means you will hunt for bourbon, which sounds active and almost dangerous, but primarily involves browsing in liquor stores. Like you never see aNational Geographicon bourbon hunting. Armed only with his credit card and the knowledge his wife doesn’t know where he is. Jim forages into Bourbon’s natural habitat. It’s a pretty generous use of the term hunt, right? Especially considering the bottles aren’t hiding or trying to get away. A bourbon hunt is much closer to an Easter egg hunt if all the eggs were put in the carton and handed to the person. “I won!” There are stages to a bourbon obsession, right? The first stage is the awakening. You try bourbon and you realize not all hard liquor needs to taste like lighter fluid. The next stage is you try premium bourbon which propels you to the third stage which is collecting. But you tell yourself you’re not going to overdo it. Just a couple bottles. You’re not going to sleep out in your car for a rare release or hide a purchase from your wife. And then the fourth stage, you sleep out in your car and you hide a purchase from your wife. The final stage of a bourbon obsession is you start watching YouTube videos of other men hunt for bourbon. Now, I understand that may sound pathetic, but believe me, it’s much worse. In these videos, this guy, middle-aged guy, out of shave, if you can picture that, he just goes into liquor stores and comments on the bourbon selection. He’s like, “That one’s all right. That’s that’s overrated.” I’m watching an alcoholic shop… and it is riveting… and informative. And I tell you, after I watch a couple of these videos, I realize a porn addiction would be less embarrassing. “What are you doing?” “Nothing. Nothing. Clear browser history.” Now, I know that’s been a lot of bourbon talk, so now I’d like to talk about something that I think we’d all find fascinating.Liquor stores. I do love liquor stores. I love how liquor stores always have super creative names like Discount Liquors. Bob’s Bargain Depot. Like, you would never eat in a restaurant named Discount Beef. “I knew he was serious when he took me to Discount Beef.” Occasionally, liquor stores will have cute, clever names. In New York where I live, there’s a liquor store called City Sliquors with a Q. City Sliquors. Hysterical. But the name of a liquor store has no effect on the business. No one’s walking by City Sliquors and think, “Well, I don’t drink alcohol, but I sure love a Billy Crystal movie. Maybe I should start” Now, liquor stores know. They know they don’t have to try to get customers. We’re coming. They could name a liquor store Loser Depot. People be like, “Wow, I got to go in there anyway. Maybe that’s a French name,Losér Depót.” I love the aesthetic inside of a liquor store. It’s almost as if some interior designer was like, “What if the whole store looked like the back room?” We want people to feel like they’re in an episode ofHoarders. There’s a silence you only find in liquor stores. You ever notice that? People walk around all serious like they’re in an art gallery. “Interesting. Maybe this will make the pain go away.” Liquor stores have their own vibe, right? There’s a decidedly divorced dad energy, right? A stack of boxes suddenly becomes a shelf. It’s not dirty, but it’s certainly not clean. Things are handwritten, crossed out. You feel like you’ve stumbled upon a garage sale in a bus station. It’s just not welcoming. Even the placement of the bottles seems a little insulting. The less expensive ones down low, it’s the store’s way of saying, “Bend your knee.” The more expensive bottles up high, it’s out of your reach. The super rare bottles are always in a glass trophy case. I was looking at like, “well, I guess if I work hard on my drinking. I could get that.” The only reason to go to a liquor store is alcohol. There’s no other reason to be there. You can’t be like, “Do you guys sell flowers? It’s my anniversary. I guess I could get her a rosé. Maybe it doesn’t.” Some liquor stores offer free samples of alcohol… during the day. They pass it out like it’s an ice cream shop. “I have not been drinking officer. I was sampling. Which, as you know, doesn’t count.” I appreciate the liquor store employees. They always offer their unbiased advice, right? “Well, what we’re trying to get rid of… I mean what we like.” That’s an interesting career choice. Liquor store employee. You’re like, “What’s that interview like?” “Oh, I see here you have a couple DUIs. Some major gaps in your employment history. When can you start showing up late? Please observe our employee dress code… whatever you slept in last night.” I can never tell who works at the liquor store. I’m like, “Do you work here? Are you about to rob me?” Liquor stores offer a store pick, right? Which is kind of like a bookstore staff pick, right? But in a bookstore, you might think, “Oh, wow. This guy John really liked this book.” But in a liquor store, you’re like, “Oh, wow. This guy John’s going to have liver failure.” In a way, bookstores are like the opposite of liquor stores, right? You go to a bookstore to enrich your life. There’s even a self-help section, but a liquor store is like an enormous self-destruct section. They might as well greet people. “How can I help you? Are you looking for your wife to leave you or just lose your job?” “Both. We’ve got just a thing. It’s called Fireball.” Now, if you’ve never tried Fireball, that means you’re leading a productive life. If you do drink Fireball, I don’t want you to feel bad, but obviously you do. You’re drinking Fireball. What a metaphor for your life. Your life is a ball on fire. It just tastes like cinnamon gum that a drunk guy chewed on. It’s not even whiskey, Fireball. Technically, it’s liquid regret. No, it’s flavored whiskey. Flavored whiskey. There’s banana flavored whiskey. There’s peanut butter flavored, apple flavored. All the all the variety a preschooler is looking for. Liquor store employees will make suggestions. They’ll make recommendations. That’s part of the the job task, right? I mean, bartenders also do that. I can never get a bartender’s attention. You know, with at least with a waiter, you can give that check signal. Can I have my check? But with a barter, you can’t be like…, of course, the highest status suggester of liquors is the sommelier, which is a French word meaning know-it-all. I don’t understand the premise behind a the sommelier. It’s like, so when we go out to dinner, we’re so intimidated by the task of selecting a wine, we need a private tutor? Like people like, uh, uh, I’d like to use my lifeline. I-Is there a functional drunk here who’s maybe tried all of these? Someone who could be condescending but also make me feel cheap. Uh, is that person here? I’ve only had a couple interactions with sommeliers, but they always make me feel like a child. Even when the waiter offers, “would you like to see our sommelier?” Like, “would you like us to get the wine, daddy? You want some help picking stuff out?” “Yeah. These kids will have the chicken fingers in the shambi, right?” “You guys want some coloring books?” “Thanks, wine daddy.” They always recommend the expensive wine, right? I’m always like, “Well, that’s an interesting choice, but I’m looking for a wine that only has two digits next to it. Preferably, the first number would be a one. Do you have anything from that region?” There are moments when you’re you’re forced to consider how much alcohol you consume, right? Like when you go to the doctor’s office and you have to fill out that form. That can feel like a reckoning cuz all the other questions are so easy. You know, any allergies? No. Any recent surgeries? No. How many alcoholic drinks a week? You’re like, “Why do you need to know? Who made this form? My mom?” “How many a week? So, we’re not counting weekends. All right. I’m going to put downsome.” My alcohol consumption will vary week to week, right? Depending if I’m celebrating something like someone’s birthday or the fact it’s dark outside. Apparently alcohol consumption among adults has dropped dramatically, right? There was a Gallup poll that found that only 54% of adults in America drink alcohol. And I heard that and I was like, “I can’t believe that many people smoke pot.” Apparently, at its peak, 71% in 1980 of adults drank alcohol. And I heard that and I was like, “That feels low.” Cuz when I was growing up, it seemed like adults were drinking all day long. Like every moment had an excuse to have a drink. Like “this is my before dinner drink. This is my wine with dinner. This is my after-dinner drink.” Anything to not have to count how many you’ve had, right? Like “this is not my eighth drink. This is my first dessert wine. Now, who wants to get a night cap?” If you do ever worry that you drink too much, here’s all you have to do. Just go to an airport bar at 8:00 a.m. I guarantee your only takeaway will be, “I’m doing great.” Cuz in the morning in airport bars, people are getting loaded and they are not being shy about it. “I’ll have Jack and Coke.” “You know you’re in public right now.The Today Showis still on the TV screen. Al Roker hasn’t done the weather yet. And you’re kind of slurring your words, fella!” Air Travel has this symbiotic relationship with alcohol. It’s not just the airport bar. They serve drinks on the plane. If you’ve ever sat in first class, sometimes they offer you champagne. “Would you like some champagne?” “Oh, what are we celebrating? Not being a coach?” There’s a direct associat… There’s even the airplane bottle. The airplane bo… No other form of transportation has their own size bottle, right? There’s no motorcycle bottle. There’s no ship bottle. Ships, they don’t even know what to do with a bottle. Sometimes they put a ship inside the bottle. Tell me that guy wasn’t drunk. “Oh, you you wanted the bottle on the ship.” I do love those airplane bottles. Whenever I’m on a plane, I always act like I’m like a giant.  I always seem to get the armrest after that. Those airplane bottles, they are adorable, right? It looks like Jack Daniels had a litter, right? Like how could having 10 of these get me in trouble? They’re fun size. That’s why I pass them out at Halloween. Yeah. “Only one. I got my eye on you, Batman.” “Jim, that’s not funny. That’s not funny. I can’t believe a clean comedian would talk about alcohol for a half an hour.” All I can say is Cosby did worse. Which would also be a great name for our bourbon… That is all for me. Thank you so much for coming out. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

In this powerful return, Kimmel mixes comedy and honesty as he thanks fellow late-night hosts and even critics for defending free speech, addresses the backlash over his Charlie Kirk comments, and warns against government threats to comedians and journalists. With humor, candor, and sharp political insight, Kimmel reminds viewers why late-night matters as more than entertainment. Read the complete Jimmy Kimmel monologue transcript from his return episode and see how he turned controversy into a statement on free expression and resilience. The episode aired on September 23, 2025 Jimmy Kimmel Delivers First Monologue Since Returning | Transcript Thank you. Thank you. Anyway, as I was saying before I was interrupted, if you’re just joining us, we are preempting your regularly scheduled encore episode ofCelebrity Family Feudto bring you this special report. I’m happy to be here tonight with you all. All right. Please be seated. I’m not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol. It’s been overwhelming. I’ve heard from a lot of people over the last six days. I’ve heard from all the people over in the world over the last six days. Everyone I have ever met has reached out 10 or 11 times. Weird characters from my past– the guy who fired me from my first radio job in Seattle where we are not airing tonight by the way. Sorry, Seattle. His name is Larry. In 1989, Larry tried to force me to do a bit called jokes for donuts where people would call in with a joke and I would give them donuts. I refused to do it and then I made a lot of fun of Larry for suggesting it and eventually Larry fired me and I had to move back in with my parents. But even he wrote in to cheer me up. Thank you, Larry. And I want to thank everyone who checked in. It would take all week to lift all of them. But some that I do especially want to mention are my fellow late night talk show hosts my friend Steven Colbear who’s found himself in this predicament. My friends John Stewart, Seth Myers, Jimmy Fallon, John Oliver, Con O’Brien, James Cordon, Arino, Kathy, Wanda, Chelsea, even Jay reached out. I heard from late night hosts in other countries from Ireland and from Germany. The guy in Germany offered me a job. Can you imagine? This country has become so authoritarian the Germans are like, “Come here. Come loose.” My boyhood idols, Howard Stern and David Letterman were very considerate and kind and I feel honored to be part of a group of people that knows what goes into doing a show like this. And I also want to thank all of you. Thanks to you who supported our show, cared enough to do something about it, to make your voices heard so that mine can be heard. I will never forget it. And maybe most of all, I want to thank the people whodon’tsupport my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway, who I never would have imagined like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Ran Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. [Ted Cruz] I hate what Jimmy Kimmel said. I am thrilled that he was fired. Oh, wait. No, not that. The the other part. [Ted Cruz] But let me tell you, if the government gets in the business of saying can’t say what you, the media, have said, “We’re going to ban you from the airwaves if you don’t say what we like.” That will end up bad for conservatives. I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but Ted Cruz is right. He’s absolutely right. This affects all of us, including him. I mean, think about it. If Ted Cruz can’t speak freely, then he can’t cast spells on the Smurfs. Even though I don’t agree with many of those people on most subjects, some of the things they say even make me want to throw up. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration, and they did, and they deserve credit for it. And thank for telling your followers that our government cannot be allowed to control what we do and do not say on television and that we have to stand up to it. I’ve been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight. And the truth is I don’t think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference. If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind. But I do want to make something clear because it’s important to me as a human and that is you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I-I don’t I don’t think there’s anything funny about it. I-I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed sending love to his family and asking for compassion and I meant it and I still do. Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some that felt either illtimed or unclear or maybe both. And for those who think I did point a finger. I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I’d have felt the same way. I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution and it isn’t it ever. And also selfishly I am a person who gets a lot of threats. I get many ugly and scary threats against my life, my wife, my kids, my co-workers because of what I choose to say. And I know those threats don’t come from the kind of people on the right who I know and love. So that’s what I wanted to say on that subject. But I don’t want to make this about me because and I know this is what people say when they make things about them, but I really don’t. This show, this show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this. I’ve had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East who tell me they would get thrown in prison for making fun of those in power and worse than being thrown in prison. They know how lucky we are here. Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country. And that’s something I’m embarrassed to say. I took for granted until they pulled my friend Steven off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities that you live in to take my show off the air. That’s not legal. That’s not American. That is unAmerican and it is so dangerous. I want you to think about that. Should the government be allowed to regulate which podcasts the cell phone companies and Wi-Fi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest? You think that sounds crazy? 10 years ago, this sounded crazy. Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, telling an American company, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way, and that these companies can find ways to change conduct and take action on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” In addition to being a direct violation of the First Amendment, is not a particularly intelligent threat to make in public. Ted Cruz said he sounded like a mafioso. Although, I don’t know. If you want to hear a mob boss make a threat like that, you have to hide a microphone in a deli and park outside in a van with a tape recorder all night long. This genius said it on a podcast. Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one. And that’s saying something. The FCC has a tradition of meddling where they shouldn’t under many administrations, but it wasn’t always like this. There was an FCC commissioner back in 2022 who worked under Joe Biden who was spoton. He wrote, “President Biden is right. Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people into the discussion. That’s why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.” You know who wrote that? FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who later was appointed chairman of the FCC by this former crusader for free speech. [Trump] If we don’t have free speech, then we just don’t have a free country. It’s as simple as that. If this most fundamental right is allowed to perish, then the rest of our rights and liberties will topple just like dominoes. One by one, they’ll go down. That was also in 2022. And I wonder how did that guy turn into this guy. [Reporter] Who would you like to see replace Kimmel on late night? [Trump] A lot of people, anybody could replace him. Guy had no talent. Kimmel had, look, he was fired. He had no talent. He’s a whack job, but he had no talent. And more importantly the talent he had no because a lot of people have no talent. They get ratings but he had no ratings. Well… I do tonight. Thank you. You almost you almost have to feel sorry for him. He tried did his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now. And a lot of people have been asking me if there are conditions for my return to the air, and there is one. Disney has asked me to read the following statement, and uh I’ve agreed to do it. Here we go. To reactivate your Disney Plus and Hulu account open the Disney Plus app on your smart TV or TV connected device. I’ve been um fortunate to work at a company that has allowed me to do the show the way we want to do it for almost 23 years. I’ve done almost 4,000 shows on ABC. And over that time, the people who run this network have allowed me to evolve and to stretch the boundaries of what was once traditional for a late night talk show, even when it made them uncomfortable, which I do a lot. Every night, they’ve defended my right to poke fun at our leaders and to advocate for subjects that I think are important by allowing me to use their platform, and I am very grateful for that. With that said, I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on one. I did not agree with that decision and I told them that and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view. They shared theirs. We talked it through and at the end, even though they didn’t have to. They really didn’t have to. This is a giant company. We have short attention spans and I am a tiny part of the Disney Corporation, and they welcomed me back on the air and I thank them for that because I know that unfortunately and I think unjustly this puts them at risk. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can’t take a joke. He was somehow able to squeeze Cole Bear out of CBS. Then he turned his sights on me. And now he’s openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows who don’t make millions of dollars. And I hope that if that happens or if there’s even any hint of that happening, you will be 10 times as loud as you were this week. We have to speak out against this because he’s not stopping. And it’s not just comedy. He’s gunning for our journalists, too. He’s suing them. He’s bullying them. Over the weekend, his Foxy friend Pete Hegsath announced a new policy that requires journalists with Pentagon press credentials to sign a pledge, promising not to report information that hasn’t been explicitly authorized for release. That includes unclassified information. They want to pick and choose what the news is. I know that’s not as interesting as musling a comedian, but it’s so important to have a free press, and it is nuts that we aren’t paying more attention to it. Walter Cronkite must be spinning in his grave right now. He’s dead, right? Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this. I barely paid attention in school. But one thing I did learn from from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn’t like is anti-American. That’s anti-American. And I am so glad we have some solidarity on that from the right and the left and from those in the middle like Joe Rogan. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on and maybe we’ll even find another one. Maybe we can get a little bit closer together. We do agree on a lot of things. We agree on keeping our children safe from guns, from reproductive rights for women, social security, affordable health care, pediatric cancer research. These are all things that most Americans support. Let’s stop letting these politicians tell us what they want and tell them whatwewant. There was a moment over the weekend, a very beautiful moment. I don’t know if you saw this on Sunday. Erica Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband. She forgave him. That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was. That’s– that’s it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply and I hope that it touches many and if there’s anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that and not this. So, thank you for listening and I’ll have– I’ll have more to say when we come back.

    "transcript":"Jon Stewart unpacks Jimmy Kimmel’s return to television amid outcry over his suspension, a sign of the times in an era where President Trump isn’t even hiding his flagrant attacks on free speech, retaliation against his political enemies, and the brazen corruption in his administration. Episode of the Daily Show Aired on September 22, 2025 Jimmy Kimmel’s Suspension Was Always About Censorship (Just Ask Trump) – The Daily Show | Transcript Welcome toThe Daily Show. My name is Jon Stewart. We’ve got a fabulous show for you tonight. Thank you so much for joining us. I will be joined later by the former prime minister of New Zealand. Jacinda Ardern will be joining us. Probably later. Find out why she forced their ABC affiliate to pullFlight of the Conchords. She did that. Folks, news is flying fast and furious. As you know, the administration teased a big announcement on the cause of autism today. O ye of little faith. This is obviously a very serious moment for the world and the United States of America. To the White House, what is the cause of autism? [Trump] The use of aceta– well, let’s see how we say that. Acetaminophen– acetaminophen– is that OK? No! No, it is not OK! We would like a second opinion and a third pronunciation. Look, there’s already a ton of controversy around the lack of data tying acetaminophen in pregnancy to autism, and you can’t even be bothered to pronounce the fucking word correctly? Until maybe you get to the one word you recognize from your medicine cabinet? [Trump] –which is basically commonly known as Tylenol. Well, I’m sure now they’re known as plaintiff A. Aceta– aceta– acetaminophen. That’s when you know– when he looks up, that’s his tell that he recognizes the word. Aceta– Tylenol! Meanwhile, in other ABC news, young Jimmy Kimmel’s coming back to television. I don’t know if you know that. Yeah. I’ll tell you, Jimmy Kimmel’s flying high like Advil today. See the minivans? Boom. Advil’s like, what’s up, motherfucker? You got a headache? Where are you going to turn? No, Kimmel’s coming back. That campaign– and I– you know what? I’m joking around. I want to say this seriously. That campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons ofOnly Murders in the Building, that really worked. Congratulations. Wasn’t it– wasn’t it interesting to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life? It’s– it’s one thing to swear offCruises, but theAvengers? Nah. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can’t watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football? Or listen to early Hilary Duff. # So yesterday # # So– # # So– # I would sing more of it. Obviously, Disney is very litigious, so– It was rather shocking that this turnaround occurred, because I was told that the original decision to get rid of Jimmy had nothing to do with the Trump administration and their explicit FCC threat that they could remove the show the easy way or the hard way. My gosh, this has nothing to do with Donald Trump not agreeing with anything Jimmy Kimmel said or not. I mean, gee willikers! All my days. I mean, I don’t know why people would think that. We just randomly remove one show a week. If Donald Trump wanted to take everyone off the air who had criticisms for him, there would basically only be a handful of individuals left on television. That is– that is funny. But it’s also maybe a cause for self-reflection? “Hey, if everyone on TV is criticizing me except for, like, four people, and one of them is my daughter-in-law, I am the drama?” Don’t take my word for it. Ask Trump. [Trump] I’m a very strong person for free speech. Almost inevitably, a statement like that will be followed up by abut, however, although, that being said. But if you really– it’s like one of those phrases like, I don’t see color, but– so Trump’s saying he’s strong for free speech. Well, let’s see that big butt of yours. [Trump] At the same time, when you have networks that– where I won an election, like in counties, I guess it’s 2,600 to 525. It’s called landslide– a landslide times 2. Yeah. I don’t know if you’re aware of this. We don’t quantify elections by county. We never have. We don’t judge the election by how many counties one person wins and one person loses. Presidents don’t ever say, “well, I lost the popular vote in the electoral college, but I won the land mass”. That’s not how these go. So Trump is up 2,600 counties to 525. And I guess if you were to divide that by the negativity directed at him– [Trump] But 97%, 94%, 95%, 96% of the people are against me in the sense of the– the newscasts are against me. The stories are 90– they said 97% bad. So they gave me 97. they’ll take a great story, and they’ll make it bad. You see what we have here, people? 2,600 counties minus 525 counties divided by negative 97. I think you see what this all adds up to. [Trump] See, I think that’s really illegal, personally. Boom! Let me explain something. Free speech has always been a ratio. If the county vote were more equal, you could take a good story and make it bad without being jailed. But as our founders stated in the Constitution, when the delta between the sigma of counties divided by factorials of negativity are greater than pi, your inalienable rights turn into more of a expired groupon. I’m sorry, that’s just how it goes. I didn’t make the rules. Blame the founders. Now, free speech– Free speech isn’t the only tent post of a free society facing redefinition. There’s also this. [Trump] We’re bringing back law and order to our country. Oh, we’re not talking about the show? Oh, OK. Because I’m not sure that’s ever left us. He’s talking about law and order as a foundational principle of civilized society. So how does Donald Trump propose bringing law and order back? [Reporter] President Trump is publicly putting pressure on the Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi. In a post on Truth Social, the president said, “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” adding, “Justice must be served.” You post that? Publicly? Sir, far be it for me to tell you how to run your post-judicial lawfare. But do we all have to be copied on this shit? We know– we know you and Bondi talk in private. (FAKE-COUGHS) Epstein. Oh, I’m sorry. Ep– Eps– [FAKE-COUGHS] I have a– a Epstein’s file– a cold. I have a cold. Now, most people would think a president ordering his independent Department of Justice to go after his political opponents is weaponizing the Department of Justice. That’s why most people don’t work in this administration. [Karoline Leavitt] It is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponized the Department of Justice. Yes. This is lawfare, but this lawfare is only fair because of how he fared under– I’ve run out of road for the metaphor. But I think you understand– but, look, man, if Letitia James committed a crime, she should be held accountable. But what if she hadn’t committed a crime? [Reporter] Trump forced out top federal prosecutor Erik Siebert after his office failed to find incriminating evidence against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He fi– he fired him for not finding evidence that Trump is going full Devil Wears Prada on this one. I want an indictment for Letitia James on my desk, or you’re fired! But, Mr. Trump, it’s 3:00 in the morning, and she didn’t do anything. You woke [INDISTINCT] her! There’s a thousand girls who would take your place in a second. And that sweater is pedestrian. And so– that’s my– I’ve never seen the movie, so I don’t– I– if you’ve seen the movie, you’d probably go, I don’t think that’s the movie. By the way, this Siebert fella was appointed by Trump earlier this year. Look, at this point, it’s so blatantly an abuse of power, and yet his defenders continue to reframe this as refreshing. [Reporter] He’s asking his attorney general in a public way to go after his political enemies. Very open about it. You’re OK with that? [Sen. Markwayne Mullin] Well, I think what we know is President Trump is very open and transparent with the American people, and he speaks his mind. And that’s what his supporters love about him, and that’s what America loves about him. No, that’s what America loves about Dolly Parton. Transparent, speaks her mind. Yet Dolly rarely jails her political enemies. I mean, Senator Markwayne– Mark hyphen wayne backslash Mullin– do you want to know how embarrassing your weak-kneed rationalization for jailing political opponents ring? I’m going to play you a clip of a fellow senator, a fellow Republican senator. By the way, that’s majority opinion, not just here. Now, Cruz has supported this president through insults to his own wife’s looks and to his own father’s loyalties. And yet Cruz still manages to maintain a modicum of self-respect when it comes to this president trampling all over our Constitution. Sir, it brings me no pleasure to have to play this. [Ted Cruz (on recording)] Look, I like Brendan Carr. He’s a good guy. He’s the chairman of the FCC. I work closely with him. But what he said there is dangerous as hell. Fantastic. Fantastic! Senator Ted Cruz boldly stating that the FCC chairman threatening the licenses of networks is dangerous. And, Senator Cruz, I would just say, maybe you should stop there. I would stop there. I would not continue with the thought. Perfect. No notes. All right, go on. [Ted Cruz] And I gotta say, he threatens it. He says, (BOSTON ACCENT) we could do this the easy way, or we could do this the hard way. The fuck? We’re talking about “the hard way”? What kind of mobster have you ever heard. (GOOFY BOSTON ACCENT) we could do this the hard way. Uh, we could do it the easy way, the hard way? Easy or hard? (NORMAL VOICE) It’s notThe Godfather. That’s Lennie fromMice and Men. (GOOFY BOSTON ACCENT) I– I ain’t your bunny. The bunny can do it the easy, the hard way. (NORMAL VOICE) You got– you got more, Senator, don’t you? [Ted Cruz (on recording)] And I gotta say, that’s right out ofGoodfellas. (STAMMERING) That’s right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, (BOSTON ACCENT) nice bar you have here. It’d be a shame if something happened to it. That’s not aGoodfellasquote. I know this because all of my decorative pillows have Goodfellas quotes on them. I mean, I would go home, I would say– that’s me at home. Look at me. Now, Senator, a lesser man might tell you to go home and get your fucking shine box. But I don’t, because you wouldn’t even know what that means. Ted Cruz, I mean, to do that withGoodfellas, with that accent, is there anything in pop culture that I love that you can’t ruin? (IMITATING LISA) But, Dad, I’m a vegetarian. I don’t eat animals.(IMITATING HOMER) But, Lisa, animals are so delicious. There’s the animal we get bacon from, the animal we get ham from, the animal we get sausage from.(IMITATING LISA) Dad, that’s all the same animal.(IMITATING MR. BURNS) Smithers, release the hounds. Excellent. They’re not booing. They’re saying “boo-urns.” Imagine having to endure a Texas power outage with this guy. Who wants to hear my Apu? Anyone? Well, he ruined my love ofThe Simpsons. At least I’ve still got my favorite franchise,Star Wars, all to myself, so I don’t have to– (DEEP VOICE) The force is strong with this one. Mm! There is no try. Do or do not. At best, he sounds like Yoda with a sinus infection, trying not to cum. Do or do– You may enjoy Star Wars, Ted Cruz, but there’s one thing we’ll never have in common. And that’s my comfort movie,The Princess Bride, a fantastical tale of adventure and true love, with an outstanding cast and– oh, you know what’s coming. You know what’s coming. With an outstanding cast, including the inimitable– oh, fuck it. Just roll it. So what is it you have that’s so worth living for?Presses on his chest, and– and Wesley goes. True love.Liar! Shut up, witch! I’m not a witch. I’m your wife. But after what you just said, I wish I wasn’t. Don’t say that name. What? Humperdinck. Humperdinck, Humperdinck, Humperdinck. I can’t hear you. So–Wow. That was a straight– I’m like, oh, the one-man show. Do you know how hard it is to make Mario Lopez uncomfortable? Truly, Mario Lopez, the man who, need I remind you, did this dance in a tank tee in front of everyone at the Maxx. Look, I don’t want to get sidetracked by Ted Cruz’s Vegas residency. I just want to say this to Trump’s defenders. You don’t have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump’s authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law. He does not give a fuck anymore. He’s saying it straight up. Trump is saying, the people like dictators. Trump is saying, “I hate my opponents, and I want them punished.” And Trump is saying, “I’ll use all the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal.” So you can get on board with that and say, I’m with that, or you can join the rest of us and fight like hell for this constitutional republic. Because let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Hold on. It is a form of representational government worth preserving and defending. And as the great Winston Churchill once said– (CRUZ IMITATING WINSTON CHURCHILL) We shall never surrender!

    "transcript":"Jon Stewart takes Trump’s U.K. trip and rips it to shreds—mocking the royal strut, the “Aberbaijan” geography lesson, and the idea that our sun-god president single-handedly ended every war on Earth. Then it’s on to Jimmy Kimmel’s firing, which Trump insists was about “bad ratings,” though Stewart points out it looks a lot like punishment for not kissing the ring. Enter the magical “talentometer,” a White House device that measures niceness to the president. Add in the GOP’s free-speech double standards—don’t call us fascists while we call you animals—and you get Stewart’s punchline: free speech isn’t dying, it’s being rigged. The Daily ShowSeptember 18, 2025 Jon Stewart’s Post-Kimmel Primer on Free Speech in the Glorious Trump Era | Full Transcript ANNOUNCER: From Comedy Central, it’s the all new, governmentapprovedDaily Showwith your patriotically obedient host,Jon Stewart. [INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC] My name is… my name is Jon Stewart. And welcome toThe Daily Showon I’m going to guess Monday. I don’t know. We have another fun, hilarious, administration compliant show. What are you doing? Shut up! Don’t fucking blow this for us. So we’re… we’re coming to you tonight from a real shithole, the crime-ridden cesspool that is New York City. It is a tremendous disaster, like no one’s ever seen before. Someone’s National Guard should invade this place. Am I right? If you felt a little off these past couple of days, it’s probably because our great father has not been home. For Father has been gracing England with his legendary warmth and radiance. Gaze upon him with a gait even more majestic than that of the royal horses that prance before him. He wowed the English with charm, intelligence, and an undeniable sexual charisma that filled their air like a pheromonepacked London fog. And as part of this historic trip, the perfectly tinted Trump… …dazzled his hosts at dinner with a demonstration of unmatched oratory skill. [Trump] A fifth of all that humanity speaks, writes, thinks, and prays in the language born on these isles and perfected in the pages of Shakespeare and Dickens and Tolkien, Lewis, Orwell, and Kipling. Incredible… people. He didn’t have to look down once… …completely off book as he namechecked his favorite authors from the top of his head. Trump employing restraint not to quote verbatim these great authors our president has devoured voraciously… incredible people, indeed. I’ll tell you whose client list Trump’s name is on Dewey Decimal’s. But of course, as great as those authors are, there can only be one most tremendous author in the English language. And I think we know that that author begins with a T and ends in key. Oh, how fortune has smiled upon us, for that very scribe is also our dear leader. [Trump] We’re joined by history and fate, by love and language. We’re like two notes in one chord, or two verses of the same poem. Each beautiful… on its own but… really meant to be played together. The whole room is enthralled! That’s resting interest face. It was a most beautiful recitation, Mr. President. It brings me to tears, almost as much as your favorite poem about that man from Nantucket… …and the variety of things that man can do that rhyme with tucket. Although, Mr. President, if I may humbly, I beg of you, take a small detour off this highway of adoration you have so richly earned for a bit of a comic repast, um, what the fuck is on this guy’s head? Hang all the mistletoe you want, Earl of Higgin Hoffenballum. Our president’s luscious lips shall never grace your forehead. Or is that fucking… is that some sort of secondrate Harry Potter scar shit? What’s on his head? (IN BRITISH ACCENT) He’s scarred with the mark of the fern. (IN REGULAR ACCENT) Leviacus Growatosis. But the president, almost despicably humble, gave the royals a rare glimpse at his softspoken yet prideful side. [Trump] We had a very… sick country one year ago, and today… I believe we’re the hottest country… anywhere in the world. In fact, nobody’s even questioning it. Certainly not this fucking guy. Am I right? You got something to say to me, King Chuck? Don’t make eye contact, bitch. I’m the alpha dog. Trump knows, USA is the hottest we’ve ever been and not just because of climate change, which is a good thing. It’s actually… climate change is… it’s a good thing. Cities should be part of the ocean… …if you think about it. Because obviously, what’s more important than staying hydrated for cities? Of course, this visit wasn’t just an opportunity for President Trump to rub shoulders with lesser royals. He also met with political leaders, like the British prime minister, who had to be reminded that Trump has ended all the wars in the world, especially the one between Azerbaijan and Armenia. [Trump] To think that we settled “Aberbaijan” and Albania, as an example. I would like to apologize very quickly. I stand corrected. Azerbaijan is actually pronounced “Aberbaijan.” And Armenia is pronounced… Albania. I regret the error. Trump ended the war between “Aberbaijan” and Albania. Do better! Do better! Do better! Fucking dumb shit, fucking… buh! That wasn’t smart either. Now, the visit to England couldn’t have gone better for our president. Finally, a country affording our great leader the respect and deference that any sun god would command. [Reporter questioning Trump] We saw the dismissal of a very wellknown chat show host in America last night, Mr. Kimmel. Is free speech more under attack in Britain or America? What outfit are you with, sir, theAntifa Herald Tribune? Why, I wouldn’t even line my parrot’s cage with your rag. There’s a very reasonable explanation for what befell this scallywag, Kimball. [Trump, replying to reporter] Well, Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else. And he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk. And Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings. And they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not. You may call it free speech in jolly old England. But in America, we have a little something called the First Amendment. And let me tell you how it works. There’s something called a talentometer. It’s a completely scientific instrument that is kept on the president’s desk. And it tells the president when a performer’s TQ, Talent Quotient, measured mostly by niceness to the president, goes below a certain level, at which point the FCC must be notified to threaten the acquisition prospects for billiondollar mergers of network affiliates. These affiliates are then asked to give ultimatums to even larger mega corporation that controls the flow of stateapproved content. Or the FCC can just choose to threaten those licenses directly. It’s basic science. Read the Constitution! Read the Constitution! Look, there are certain rules of free speech that we must all abide by. But in case anyone needs a refresher, we’re going to go over the rules again. He does not have a right to have a television show where he lies his ass off to the American people. There are repercussions to spreading lies. And even though two months ago, our president, because of his grand ability to see the future it’s a curse… …somehow knew that Kimball would be next, as he explicitly said, you can’t just make things up on television. People cannot just go on television and mislead viewers with madeup crap. Millions of illegal aliens that border czar Harris brought into the country will be voting. The bottom line is this. There is massive voter fraud. Global warming is a hoax. Crime, crime is at an alltime high right now. $50 million on condoms in Gaza. They’re taking people’s pets and killing them and eating them. On January 6, two years ago, the overwhelming majority were peaceful. They were orderly and meek. These were not insurrectionists. They were sightseers. I do not know whence these peasants come. That last roll of clips, all true, especially that last one about sightseers. Because technically, anything you see is a sight. Even… even if… even if that iseven if that is you punching a cop. I see. Therefore, I am sightseeing. But of course, even before this Jason Kringle situation at ABC, there were plenty of other people in America exercising their free speech incorrectly. So here are some examples of things you cannot say about your political opponents. You can’t call someone who you disagree with a fascist. Leaders cannot call their political opponents Nazis and fascists and enemies of the state. How horrible and dangerous it is to view people with whom we disagree as somehow being less than human. Thank you. You can’t say fascist. You can’t say enemy of the state. You can’t say less than human. These are simple rules that any responsible member of a society can easily follow. [Trump] The Democrats, they’re fascists. [Trump] Joe Biden, he’s an enemy of the state. [Trump] It’s a very demonic party. [Trump] Nancy Pelosi said, please don’t call them animals. They’re human beings. I said, no, they’re animals. Of course, I think she’s an animal too, you want to know the truth. Anyway, he said that a long time ago, back when I was doing a semester abroad in “Abubaijan.” You know what? It’s not really about the specific words. It’s about having a basic sense of humanity. People on the left are much likelier to defend and celebrate political violence. This is not a bothsides problem. The First Amendment, though, does not protect entertainers who say crass or thoughtless things, as Jimmy Kimmel did. Thank you. Thank both of you. Or I think we only have to be nice to one of you. You know, it is true. I do… point taken. Only a bad person would celebrate violence or make crass jokes about it. Nancy Pelosi, well, she’s got protection when shes in DCapparently, her house doesn’t have a lot of protection. Donald Trump, Jr. shared an image of a hammer and a pair of underwear that had the caption, “Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready.” Well, maybe Paul Pelosi needs the hammer instead of the metal. Well, it’s metal. All right. Rachel, good to… No, no, no. Stop. And by the way, there were consequences. This gentleman had to leave television. I’m not sure where he went. But I’m sure it’s not some prestigious, consequential position he’s not remotely qualified for. Listen, these two… these two… These two could learn a lesson from our dear president, who, like Santa, knows that we are all God’s children and would never… that is what Santa is, right? God’s… or is thatI’m not so up on the lore. I know he’s good. But the president knows we’re all God’s children. And the president would never make light of a politically motivated attack. [Trump] We’ll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco. [Trump] How’s her husband doing, by the way? Anybody know? You see, that’s how it’s done. You stop in the middle of a speech to inquire about the condition of an 82yearold man, who was attacked with a hammer in his own home. He has a fractured skull, Mr. President. But thank you for asking. Your kindness is only outshined by your manliness. So I don’t know who this… …I don’t know who this… this… Johnny Drimmel Live ABC character is. But the point is, our great administration has laid out very clear rules on free speech. Now, some naysayers may argue that this administration’s speech concerns are merely a cynical ploy, a thin gruel of a ruse, a smokescreen to obscure an unprecedented consolidation of power and unitary intimidation, principleless and coldly antithetical to any experiment in a constitutional republic governance. Some people would say that. Not me, though I think it’s great. For more, we go to our correspondents, who are live at the DonaldHam LincTrump Monument and Casino. Very much appreciate it. Very much appreciate you joining us. Guys, you know, all this swirling around… are the naysayers and the critics right? Is Donald Trump stifling free speech? (IN MONOTONE) Of course not, John. Americans are free to express any opinion we want. To suggest otherwise is laughable. Ha, ha, ha. We are a nation of diverse perspectives. And we are not afraid to be different. Ronny, Ronny, Ronny, what’s up with your tie? You’re going to get us in trouble. No, this is… this is the only red tie I have, OK? It’s fine. That’s not red. It’s… it’s pink. It’s not pink. It’s at least salmon, all right? That’s… that’s a shade of red. It’s not red enough. It’s gotta be MAGA red. Can you calm down? God, is this your first dictator? Listen. They don’t care about the exact shade, OK? It’s just about being visibly uncomfortable while you praise them like a toddler. We love you, Donald. You did so good. You get all your poopy in your potty. I couldn’t have said it any differently without, obviously, getting into trouble.

    "transcript":"Malik Elassal: Woke Flat Earthers Don’t Tell ComedyPublished date:November 15, 2023 Malik Elassal jokes about defying his conservative Muslim teachers to do comedy, the difficulty of flexing as a comedian, his relationship with his boundary-less mother, and creating “hate-crime-proof” hijabs. He also critiques his new-age therapist, Helen, and discusses anger, celebrity controversy (Kyrie Irving\/Kanye), and his family’s Lebanese history. Shout out to all the teachers that told me I’d never make it. I just like to repeat stuff that rappers say — that makes me feel good. But my teachers legit did not believe in me. Like, I went to a Muslim school, like I went to Islamic private school, and I told them that I wanted to do comedy. And they had never even heard of that, so they’re just like, “No, you want people to laugh at Muslims?” I was like, “Yeah, kind of, yeah.” I had another teacher who was also the Imam — he was like the religious leader — and he found out that I wanted to do comedy. He took me aside in, like, a private moment and he said, “You want to be a funny guy, huh? You think this life is funny, my friend? Funny in games when you see the power of Allah on the Day of Judgment, brother, you will not be laughing.” And I was just like, “I’m still going to do it.” It made me want to do it even more so that I could be like all the rappers that I looked up to. You know, like, I did have teachers that did believe in me — but that’s not good for my narrative, so I like to just focus. I was listening to a Meek Mill song one time, and in the middle of the song Meek Mill goes, “To the teachers that said I wouldn’t make it here, I spend a day what you make a year.” And I heard that, and I was like, “I’m going to flex just like that as soon as I get on.” And then I became a comedian. And it’s good — a little hard to flex though, to be honest with you. Like, what could I even say to the teachers that said I wouldn’t make it here? “I’ll make a year what you make a year”? Like, that doesn’t sound as good. “You didn’t believe in me — and now we’re roommates, dumbass. Good job.” Yeah, he told me I was going to starve in front of the whole class. I remember he said, “You want to be a comedian? You’re going to be very hungry, my friend.” And I wish he could see me now. I’d be like, “Bro, I’ve never been hungry a single day of my life, ’cause I still live with my parents, asshole. Did you think about that? No, you didn’t. I’m never hungry — my mom cuts me fruit all the time, and then she brings it into my room, ’cause she has zero boundaries. She just walks right in.” My mom’s sick, man. She’s a, you know, she’s a Muslim woman — she wears a hijab. I don’t look very Muslim, like, just off look, so nobody ever bothers me about it. You know, she wears a hijab, she looks Muslim all the time. One time she told me a story — yeah, it’s like a Halloween costume, she looks Muslim all the time, you know? So one time she told me that she was driving around and a guy pulled up next to her in traffic and saw that she was wearing the hijab, and he, like, flipped her off. And then he, like, followed her in his car for a while. And I was, like, terrified when she told me this. I didn’t want to ask her this question, but I asked. I was like, “Mom, have you ever, like, thought about taking off your hijab?” And she was like, “Malik, I would rather die a martyr than let those people change me.” I was like, “All right, Tupac, fucking relax. Jesus, chill out. Don’t talk like that. Don’t ‘wish a motherfucker would’ — that’s exactly the opposite of what I wanted.” She’s nuts, crazy talk. But I was proud of her. Like, I don’t want her to change anything about herself, but I want her to be safe. So it’s like, what do we do here? You know, like something’s got to change. Society’s not going to change, so it’s like we got to figure something out. What I’m thinking of doing is coming out with a line of hate-crime-proof hijabs that my mom can wear — completely hate-crime-proof. Okay, first one I’m thinking: standard, just Confederate flag hijab, ’cause listen — that’s going to short-circuit. Nobody’s going to know what to do when they see that. Next time some guy pulls up next to my mom in traffic, he’s gonna be like, “She got us. She wore the piece of cloth that we like.” This is another one — this is a prototype, I don’t know if it’s ready for the streets just yet — but, um, all-way hijab, but just a little bit pointy in the back. Just a little bit pointy, not all the way, but just deceptively pointy. Just for some peace of mind. I am looking for peace of mind, man. I’ve been going to a therapist for four years. I think it’s a scam — at least I don’t have a good therapist. Like, I didn’t get referred by a doctor; I just went online, like I just Googled “help please, please help.” And then it took me to a website, and on the website it was like, “Write out a list of your problems so we can use that to match you up.” And I was like, “All right.” And I selected anxiety, ’cause that’s what I was having. And then it was like, “Write out the anxiety, explain what that feels like so that we can use that to better match you up to somebody.” And I was like, “It’s anxiety, it’s not going to make sense.” I was like, “Okay, I’m not as good of a Muslim as I was raised to be, but I still feel like a good person. You know, and I feel conflicted, ’cause in school they taught us that everything is written before we’re even born, like all my decisions are made for me. So am I just doomed to make these mistakes that God wrote for me? Like, what if Allah judges me unfairly?” And then I submitted that, and then they were like, “You should talk to Helen about this. Helen’s good for shit like this — she’s on top of it, trust me.” And I was like, “Helen? Are you even listening to what — what is Helen going to do? You couldn’t have brought me like a Dr. Mahmood El Shabaz? Somebody to just tell me to pray — ‘Brother, your life is Haram, of course you feel terrible.’ At least he understands what’s—” I’m going to be in a meeting with Helen, she’s going to be like, “Tell me more about this Allah character. He sounds toxic. I mean, why would you hang out with a guy like that? Who is he to judge you?” And I’m like, “Well, he’s actually — he’s the only one who can.” So — and that’s my therapist, Helen. I’ve been with Helen for about four years, and we get into arguments. Like, I’ll fight with Helen, ’cause she just tries too much, too new-agey ideas, it’s not practical. This is when I knew I had to find someone else — when she asked me what my astrological sign was in the middle of a session. My therapist was like, “What’s your star sign?” I was like, “Helen, come on. We can’t both be mentally ill, you know? It’s got to be — we’re just two crazy people yelling at each other now. We don’t need to be in an office.” She’s like, “You’re an Aries.” And I was like, “You’re good, Helen. You can stay.” Yeah, I’m working on it, you know, ’cause I get angry a lot. So I’m trying to figure out, like, what’s good, what’s the right thing to get angry about. ’Cause there’s stuff that’s just not worth it. This is when I realized I had to stop doing it — when Kyrie Irving got in trouble. When Kyrie got in trouble, that was big, ’cause he was, like, my favorite basketball player. He’s one of the best of this generation. And he — yeah, he got in trouble ’cause he shared an antisemitic documentary on his Twitter. It was wild. Like, the documentary denied the Holocaust — it was nuts. And they wanted to kick him out of the NBA. And I agreed, I’m like, “This is bullshit, there’s no place for that.” But then I caught myself in the middle of it, and I was like, “Wait a second — why am I even mad at this guy? A year before this, he said he thought the Earth was flat.” Like, if a guy tells you that he thinks the Earth is flat, don’t ask him about the Jews. Like, what are you doing? What did you think he was going to say? Hey, if you walked in on your girlfriend cheating on you, you don’t need to be like, “Let me see your phone right now, unlock your phone. I can see the way this guy’s hitting it from the back — you’re lying, I can tell.” There’s no woke flat-earthers. There’s never been. There’s nobody who’s like, “The Earth is flat, but you know, I love everybody on it. We’re all doing our best on this frisbee ride in space, man, that’s traveling upwards to simulate gravity. We’re all doing our best, and we gotta pay attention, ’cause it’s heating up — the disc is heating up — and the water’s going to rise, it’s going to pour off the side, we gotta be careful.” People don’t usually double up on causes like that. They’re like, “The Earth is flat, and there’s too many Filipinos on it, and it’s going to tip over if we don’t find the edge that the Jews are hiding from us and push them.” Like, who cares? He’s a basketball player. He’s not making the rules. Kanye was the same thing. That was tough for me, when Kanye got in trouble, ’cause I’ve been a Kanye apologist my whole life. Every time Kanye said something stupid, I was always the guy in the back of the room being like, “Just wait for the album, bro. You don’t get it. He’s in the future — you’re not an artist, how could you get it?” And then he was like, “I’m going to go Defcon 3 on the Jews.” And I was like, “This better be a good album. This sounds like the past, Ye, to be honest with you.” My family’s from Lebanon, you know. I’m from Canada, like, I was raised in Canada, but my mom was raised over in Lebanon. She tells me wild stories about what that was like for her. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, so my mom grew up with Israeli tanks rolling through her village. Like, they used to come into the house and do check stops all the time — it’s a crazy way to grow up. One day, the Israeli military fired a missile at my grandma’s house, and it broke through the wall and just landed inside and just spun out. It just didn’t explode — the missile just did not go off. And they all just had to back away from the missile and just pray that nothing happened. And then the Israeli military just came and scooped it up. They’re like, “Sorry about that,” and then they just took it and left. But if that missile went off, I would have never existed — my whole family would’ve been vapor. I wouldn’t be here talking to you guys right now. So I still listen to Kanye sometimes, you know. Like, I feel that’s fair. Bro, when I woke up today and saw the news, I was like, “My taping!” You guys are a dope crowd, that’s good, thank God. Bro, I swear, if I’m unlucky, Kanye’s going to drop tonight — he’s going to drop the most racist album you’ve ever heard. So this is the first year of me doing stand-up where I’ve gotten to travel a lot, and it’s been very fun. It’s a lot of travel — I’m not complaining — but it’s, you know, a lot. So I’m trying to figure out how to streamline that experience, ’cause something would always go wrong. I would lose my boarding pass or something, and then I’d be in the line fumbling with my email, holding it up. So I started doing this thing where I’d make my phone background my boarding pass, just so it’d be easy to scan real quick. But I also do this thing where sometimes before I come on stage, I make my phone background a list of my jokes, just so it’s easy for me to reference — just like one or two words to remind me. And I forgot to switch it. And I just went to get on the plane — I just showed a nice lady that works at the airport a list that said: Islamic schoolProve them all wrongBulletproof hijabMy therapist is the crazy one And I was just sitting there like, “Oh no, no — I just, I think that stuff’s funny.” Thank you guys very much.

    "transcript":"Matt Rife: Unwrapped – A Christmas Crowd Work Specialis a 2025 holiday-themed comedy special released byMatt Rifeexclusively on Netflix. The special was filmed in Phoenix (Tempe), Arizona. Directed by Rife’s friend and fellow comedian Erik Griffin. It was executive produced by Rife and Christina Shams under Rife’s Carpe Noctem banner. The special gained early attention for a promotional trailer featuring Macaulay Culkin and Charlie Sheen in aHome Alone-inspired parody. Release Date:December 2, 2025 (Netflix) Matt Rife walks onto a stage in Tempe, Arizona—the “Christmas capital of the world,” he calls it, already winking at the absurdity—and proceeds to demonstrate both why he became famous and why that fame may be built on sand. His Netflix special “Unwrapped” is a curious document: part stand-up, part crowd interrogation, part therapy session for an audience that came prepared to be roasted and left wondering if they’d been had. The opening twenty minutes reveal the comedian Rife wishes he were. He riffs on discovering Santa isn’t real around the same age boys discover masturbation, builds a theory about believing in Santa only as long as your family can afford the illusion, and lands a genuinely sharp line about Kardashian Christmases featuring a man coming down the chimney dressed as a woman. But these moments of actual wit float in a sea of material that mistakes shock for substance. The Black holiday jokes strain for edginess and find only awkwardness. A crack about Khloe Kardashian looking like Lamar Odom lands with the dull thud of a comedian reaching for controversy because he hasn’t found anything funnier to say. Then comes the crowd work, which is supposed to be Rife’s bread and butter, his ticket to legitimacy. He solicits Christmas traditions and family confessions, sorting audience members into naughty and nice lists like a game show host with better cheekbones. A woman describes her mother—a polio survivor with fused ankles—who wants to “cunt punch” disabled children on charity commercials. Rife calls the mother a mermaid, then a taquito. He asks if she needs a fish tank. The audience laughs, the woman laughs, and you’re left wondering whether this is spontaneous cruelty or rehearsed cruelty dressed up as improvisation. The special’s fundamental problem is that it can’t decide what it wants to be. Rife insists he’s a stand-up comedian who does crowd work on the side, yet everything in his career suggests the opposite. Those two-minute Instagram clips that made him famous worked because brevity concealed his limitations. Stretched to an hour, the machinery becomes visible. A man mentions he was a Boy Scout leader who took kids camping, and Rife immediately pivots to pedophilia jokes, hammering the bit until discomfort fills the room. A woman who does therapeutic horseback riding for disabled people becomes a setup for murder jokes. The pattern emerges: find someone’s vulnerability, excavate it for laughs, move on before anyone notices nothing was actually funny. What’s most telling is how the production betrays itself. The camera finds its subjects with suspicious precision. The audience members deliver their stories with the timing of people who’ve been briefed. The laughter rises and falls with mechanical regularity. Even the climactic moment—a man proposing to his girlfriend—feels less like spontaneous magic and more like content designed for social media clips. Rife ends with a sincere speech about Christmas spirit and human connection, but sincerity rings hollow when it follows an hour of calculated transgression. The special concludes with Rife telling the audience he hopes they find a reason to smile. It’s a sweet sentiment from a comedian who spent the previous hour ensuring that smiles came at someone’s expense. He’s handsome, quick, and confident enough to fill a stage. What he isn’t, at least not yet, is funny enough to fill an hour. Matt Rife: Unwrapped – A Christmas Crowd Work Special (2025) | Transcript [“Mistletoe” by Justin Bieber playing] ♪ It’s the most beautiful Time of the year ♪ ♪ Lights fill the streets Spreading so much cheer ♪ ♪ I should be playing in the winter snow ♪ ♪ But I’ma be under the mistletoe ♪ ♪ I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday… ♪ Hello, everybody! Hello! Hello! Hello! Good to see ya! Thank you for coming! Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas, everybody! Thank you for being here. Thank you so much. Wow! You guys look great! [chuckling] Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh, this is awesome, man. Thank you guys so much for being a part of our Christmas special. It just felt right to do an entire show dedicated to the best holiday of the year. And you know I had to come film it at the Christmas capital of the world. Tempe, Arizona. [chuckles] Ah. [chuckling] Why not, right? What else is going on here? How do you even know Christmas has began in Arizona? This makes no sense. It looks the same year-round. I just can’t imagine hanging up Christmas lights when it’s 85 degrees and sunny outside. Whole town just looks like a fucking Margaritaville. That’s just so different for me. I grew up– I… I’m from Ohio, so like, I love… I love a white Christmas, dude. I’m sure a Black Christmas is fun too. I’m… I’m sure it’s… I’m sure it’s equally as fun. I’ve just never been invited. Christmas is fun, but Black holidays are… are… are second best. I’ll give it… I’ll give it that. Juneteenth, that’s a newer one. Thank you. Friday. Black Friday. [chuckling] Ash Wednesday. [Matt] But aside… [chuckling] Black holidays just don’t have a Santa. That’s the only thing keeping them from being number one. I love Santa Claus, dude. When you’re a child, Santa’s everything, man. Until he’s not. Do you remember when you found out Santa wasn’t real? Spoiler alert. Yeah. Took a chunk out of your childhood, didn’t it? It killed a little piece of you. It’s different with every person, right? How you find out about Santa. For some people, it’s more scarring than others. For most young boys, it’s usually around the same time. It’s about 10 to 11 years old. It’s usually around the same time you learn how to masturbate. It’s kind of coincidentally. It’s pretty obvious too. Your Christmas list starts to look a little different. You’re like, socks. All socks this time. As many… As many socks as you want to bring me. They will… They will get used. That changes everything when you find out your parents are Santa Claus. You’re like, “My Christmas is in the hands of these people?” You start paying a lot closer attention to the family’s financial situation. You’re like, Mom’s home a lot. Shouldn’t this be a two-income house? Turn these lights off. Nobody’s even in this room. Just wasting money. [sighs] Because then I feel like it does become about money. I have a theory. As I got older, I developed a theory that you only get to believe in Santa for as long as you can afford to. Think about it. When you’re younger, you just want cheap shit, right? Some little race cars. Some little action figures. Cheap stuff you can buy in abundance. It’s not going to break the bank. You can wake up Christmas morning, like, “How did I get all these toys?” And your parents can be like, “Must be magic.” It’s like $80. Not that big of a deal. Around the same time you hit 10, 11 years old, they see an Xbox on my Christmas list and they’re like, “Oh, we… we gotta tell him.” “That’s…” [exhales heavily] Because what’s easier to believe? That Santa got caught at the border, and the tariffs are keeping you from getting an Xbox? Or that none of this is real, and divorce is on the horizon, you know. Not everything’s as magical as it seems. I… I really do believe that you get to believe in Santa for as long as you can afford to. I bet the Kardashians still believe in Santa. Why not? They can definitely afford to. They have so much money. I bet to this day, every year, a man comes down the chimney dressed up as a woman. I’d be willing to bet. [chuckling] I would be… Cool. [audience cheering, applauding] An applause break for Trana Claus? That’s uh…That’s… That’s awfully telling, Arizona. Bro, how many Black Santas have been in the Kardashian house? Like, each year? I’ve never had a Black Santa, but it… it sounds like a good time. But also, can you imagine Lamar Odom as Santa Claus? Bro, I know that’s a little older of a reference. If you don’t know who Lamar Odom is, he’s thehugeBlack basketball player that Khloe Kardashian used to look like. Um… Yeah, she’s… she’s had a little Christmas magic done, just a little bit. But once the magic of Santa Claus is out the window, I kind of feel like it’s up to your friends and family to keep that Christmas spirit alive. I think that happens via traditions, right? The things you guys do together collectively for the holidays. And growing up, I didn’t really realize the traditions I was missing out on. We had a very normal Christmas. It was never anything extravagant and amazing, but it was never a bad Christmas. You’d wake up, you do stockings, open your gifts, play with your gifts till dinner’s done. That’s pretty much it. It’s a great Christmas. Very blessed to have that. I got older, found out the kind of things my friends were doing, and I was like, I feel like I missed out on a lot of Christmas. So one of the things I wanted to talk to you guys tonight about was I want to get to know some of your family Christmas traditions because I’m getting older. I’m 30. I want to… I want to have a family, get married, have kids, and I want to have some fun traditions to pass down to them that they can then pass down to their kids someday. So I’m curious if there’s anybody here tonight who has any fun family Christmas traditions that I could then pass down to my kids to make my family better than yours someday. [woman] We play an adult White Elephant. An adult White Elephant. [woman] So one of the things that we do, like some of the gifts that we give, um, like one year somebody got, like, a weenie soap. You gave, like, a dick soap. Like it’s the shape of a dick? [woman] No, it’s just a round… just a round thing that cleans… like… [Matt] It’s just a circular thing? Get a full dick-shaped soap. So that way, people have to go, “All right.” [groans] [exhales heavily] [mutters] Okay, now a White Elephant is the one where it’s, like, everybody puts in a gift, and then you have a chance to steal it. Right? Okay. Is there a Black Elephant? [Matt] No? Maybe one where the gifts start out stolen? Hey, that’s my… Not anymore. Not anymore. [laughing] That’s so stupid. That’s so dumb. [man] One year, Grandma got the penis soap. Grandma got the penis soap? That’s a way better Christmas song than “Ran Over by a Reindeer,” by the way. [Matt chuckling] Okay. That’s a… That’s a great tradition. Hold on, he raised his hand like a good person. Hold on. What’s your tradition? [man] Uh, we come together as a family. You come together as a family. Like… All right, guys, on three. One! Two! No, Grandpa’s not ready. Grandpa’s not ready. Hold, hold, hold, hold! Hold. Come on now. Patience, patience! [chuckling] You mean you gather for the holidays? You gotta work on how you say that. [laughing] Okay. Everybody just picks a spot on the tree. Everybody find a bulb! [chuckling] Okay. So the whole family just comes together for Christmas. [man] Yeah, but it usually breaks out into an argument, and– [Matt] Breaks out into an argument? Who caused the biggest fight last year? [man] Uh, my… My grand… my grandpa. Your grandpa? How would I know that? [man] [chuckling] He got… What… What did he… What was he upset about? [woman] He collapsed. [Matt] Collapsed? Uh, he got taken in an ambulance, but… He got taken in an ambulance? You guys waited too long! I held it back, and it turned into a hernia. All right, family coming together. I feel like that’s pretty standard. What else we got? Let’s do it. Uh, the for sure gay man with… with the tattoos on his arm. [man] Every, uh, Christmas Eve, I would read, uh, “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas” to my kids, but I would change the… the words in the book. You’d read “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas” to your kids, but change the words in the book. What’s your accent? English. Nice, okay. Original Christmas. You’re… You’re Mad Libbing this book to your kids? ‘Twas the night before… Give me an example of something. [man] ‘Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even the bailiffs. Not even the bailiffs. Because the house is a prison. [Matt] Okay. Um, you know what? I like… I like a British tradition. This is a… This is a new aspect of the show. I’ve been to England a lot. I have a lot of fun there. The shows are very good. The people have always been good. You guys are just a little weird. But very good traditions. I don’t know if you guys know this, but when you… you come inside of a British girl, they call it a “shepherd’s pie.” Yeah. It’s um… It’s delicious, but it’s not for everybody, for sure. It’s… It’s a little gamy… But, um, okay. What else we got? What’s another good tradition? In the red here? [man] My family does, um, a Christmas trivia, stuff like Christmas questions. Like– Christmas questions. Who killed Jesus? “I got an idea.” “I’m not going to say who it is.” “It was the Jews.” [chuckling] It was… I like that though. The whole family plays? [woman] It’s pretty fun. And then our prize for each question is a different level of lottery ticket. Oh, you win a prize with every question. It’s not just a point system. [man] Yeah, so it goes from, like, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and I think $100 lottery ticket. [Matt] Oh, no way. Like, can you give me an example of like a $100 Christmas question? [man] I don’t know right now. I’m just now really hearing your voice, and I don’t like it. Everything sounded… I don’t know if the back can hear, but count your blessings. This is a very… a very… I said give me an example of a $100 question. She goes… [nasally] …”I don’t really know.” [chuckling] That’s caught me… You didn’t sound like that the first half of this conversation. I’m sorry. Caught me very off guard. [man] You put me on the spot! You raised your hand! [Matt] Am I crazy? Moving on. No, I do like that. My kids are definitely getting trivia. Okay. What’s another family tradition? I’ll go front here. [woman] We make tamales. You make tamales. Really? Okay. What, um… What’s your nationality? [woman] Uh, I’m Hispanic. [woman] I don’t know. I don’t know my father. You don’t know your father? Oh my God. I was like, “No way.” Hispanic and half Black? That’s amazing. No, I’m kidding. Kidding. Just… Just kidding. Just kidding. Just kidding. You really don’t know your dad? You do. Okay, don’t… Now you made me racist for no reason. [woman] I’m Mexican. We never… We don’t– Mexican. You know what? That’s actually great to be Mexican for Christmas in Arizona. You don’t have to worry about ice. That’s great. Okay, tamales. I love… I love a tamale. I ate the husks until I was about 13. I had… I had no idea. As a white person going to a… a Mexican friend’s house, I was like, “Yeah, the tamales are good, but they’re fucking hard to bite through.” And they’re like, “No, you gotta… you gotta peel it back, dude.” I was like, “Oh, all right, got it.” [woman] We’re trying so hard to hang on by a thread to keep it going because the next generation, they just can’t do it the right way. They’re like, their fingers are hurting. They’re complaining about labor. Having to go through– [Matt] Hold on. Mexicans complaining about hard work? What’s happening to this world, man? This generation’s doomed, man. [woman] It’s because they all married white boys. [Matt] They all married white boys. [woman] Yeah. We’re mixing it up.  My kids have green eyes. Your kids have green eyes. You… You married a white guy. So you’re part of the problem. Where’s your… Where’s your husband now? [woman] Oh, I don’t have one anymore. You don’t have one anymore? Oh my God. [woman] He was white. My family didn’t like him. He was white. Your family didn’t like him. It’s good to know racism’s… racism’s, you know, all the way around, you know? Oh boy. You would love my boy, Kyle. He’s in here. He’s one… He’s one of the camera ops in here. Kyle loves Latinas. He’s… He’s… He’s a… He’s a white guy, but he is about it. I promise. [woman] Tell him I said what’s up. He’s… He’s very cute. He’s, uh… Kyle’s fucked so many Latinas his dick’s permanently a hot Cheeto. Like, he… he loves that shit, man. [woman] Tell him I said what’s up. I’ll tell him. I’ll see him after the show. All right, don’t be open to it and not really be about it, okay? He’s the real deal. I want him to find love, and I know he wants a Latina. He won’t even eat your ass unless you put Tajín around the rim. Like, he’s… He’s the real deal. All right, I’ll see what I can do. Fuck it. Kyle? Oh, hilarious, he’s right there. [laughing] All right, well, it’s an open invitation, all right? [woman] It’s a Christmas miracle. Thank you. [chuckling] It’s a Christmas miracle. No problem. [chuckling] I’m going to go with the blue bow right here. [woman] Okay, we do Hanukkah, but we do Hanukkah pajamas. Hanukkah, but Hanukkah pajamas. Are they striped? [audience laughing, groaning] [Matt chuckling] Bunch of Christians. They don’t… I feel like I just ruined a whole tradition for you guys. You gotta take history into account for a lot of these traditions. When did this start? Ever since you were a kid? [woman] No, I started it when I became a mom. Oh, when you were a mom. You started it. I love that. I love seeing the first person to start something new. That’s what I’m trying to do myself. How many kids do you have? [woman] Um, five-ish. Five-ish? [woman] Um, one of them died. One of them… [Matt groans] Here’s why I don’t feel bad. She delivered it with such a sense of humor and a smile on her face. I love this is somebody who’s taken a traumatic situation and now’s found beauty in it and can have a sense of humor about it. Thank you for coming to a comedy show with that kind of energy. I appreciate it. Okay, matching pajamas. That’s a great tradition. What’s another one? [woman] [chuckling] Kwanzaa. Kwanzaa right there? No way! I’ve never met a Kwanzaanian before. I have no idea how you would even say that. I don’t know anything about it. Will you please walk me through what it’s about? [woman] So, Kwanzaa was invented by a Black guy that was like, “Fuck Christmas. We need our own shit.” It was invented by a Black guy who said, “Fuck Christmas. We need our own shit.” [woman] I mean, basically. Okay, no, that’s fine. I get it. [woman] They pulled from everywhere. There was a splash of Hanukkah, so there’s a kinara. It has candles. Oh wow. But there’s no… there’s no Santa Claus. No. Is there a figure of… of Kwanzaa? [Matt] What? No, there isn’t. Man, there should be. Just a Black guy with a beard. He’s dressed in South Pole. You guys remember South Pole, the clothing brand? Oh, bruh, if you had some South Pole and some Phat Farms in, like, 2007, you were killing it, man. Huh. So what is the celebration that is happening, then? [woman] So each day has a different meaning, uh, and a different word. So one day is, like, “unity,” one is “community,” one is “family.” [woman] I don’t even have them all memorized, but… So there is like a little table that you put up and there’s different things that represent the struggles of Black people, and there’s corn on it and harvest, and… This sounds like something not that fun for me. Okay. And today’s Black struggle is… Ooh, another one? Oh man. [chuckling] Oh shit. But there’s… there’s a word for each day. [woman] Yes, there is. Oh. Which one’s the N-word? Which day? [Matt] Wait, which one? Nia? Can I even say that? Do we gotta bleep that? Okay, you can say that one? Phew. Okay. We almost had to… We almost had to end the entire show right now. The day of Nia. Which means… [woman] [chuckles] No, I just don’t remember it. Oh, I thought you were saying Nia stood for the N-word, and I was like… I was like don’t let that be a different version of it, and I… now my whole life’s over. God, you were just saying there is one that starts with an N. Got it. Phew. Okay. Thank you. My Nia. All right. [Matt groans] [chuckling] Scared me to death. Whoo! All right. Moving on. This is good. This is a learning experience. I’ve never met somebody who celebrated Kwanzaa before. This is awesome. Thank you for being here. So we have Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, any… any Muslims here? Oh, right here? For real? Oh, no way! Nice! What’s up, y’all? How you guys doing? You guys do Christmas as well? Like the Santa version? [man] We have our own. It’s called Eid. [Matt] Eid. Yeah. What do you guys do for that celebration? [man] Um, the biggest thing is, uh, prayer usually. [man] Uh, it’s like a community-led prayer. Community leads the prayer. [man] Interestingly enough, in 2030, Eid and Christmas will be on the same day. In 2030, Eid and Christmas will be on the same day. Interesting. So in 2030, for the first time, a Muslim holiday and an American holiday will be on the same day. Wow, that hasn’t happened since 9\/11. [audience laughing, groaning] [Matt] Huh. Interesting. I’m going to stay home all of 2030, actually. No… No flights. Everybody just stay where you’re at. [Matt chuckles] Mm. You guys have your foreskin? [Matt] No? I know that’s a crazy thing to ask, but, like, if we’re… if we’re learning, why not? All right. Just curious about it. Gone. Got it. Okay. I don’t care if you guys laugh tonight or not, you learned something right now. Yeah, that could have went either way. I… I wouldn’t have had a guess either way. I’m kind of mad you guys miss out on the presents aspect of… Because for Christmas, presents is the… is the best part, dude. You wait all year just to unwrap some presents, hopefully. I’ve got to say, as much as I looked forward to getting presents as a kid, now that I’m… I’m 30, it feels so much better to give a good gift. See that expression light up on their face? Maybe it was something sentimental, something you handmade. Maybe it was something they needed that they didn’t even… They didn’t know you knew they need it. So that surprise just lights them up. I… I love that feeling now. By far the best gift I’ve ever given anybody. I don’t know how long you guys have been fans of mine or what of mine you’ve seen, but on my second YouTube special,Matthew Steven Rife, I told a story about how I bought my grandpa a pocket pussy for Christmas. And he, um… If you haven’t seen it, he broke it… …because he really enjoyed it. So the next year I got him an even better pocket pussy that was more durable. And he had that one until the day he died a few years ago. But when he did die, he passed it down to me. So now I have the pocket pussy, and we had him cremated and put inside the pocket pussy. So now every Christmas, we prop him up on the mantel above the fireplace, and it’s like he’s a part of the family for Christmas still. And in the spirit of Christmas, it really wouldn’t feel right to leave him out of the festivities. Uh, we do believe in reincarnation, so we’ve… we’ve… we’ve renamed him Ashley. And yeah, my grandpa had just never been to Arizona. You can tell the dry weather’s getting to him a little bit, but, um… couldn’t, uh… couldn’t deprive him of this… of this occasion. [chuckling] To this day, that’s the best gift I’ve ever given anybody. The… The way he lit up when he opened it… My mom knew about it too. I told her ’cause I was laughing about it too much. We all thought his reaction was gonna be like, “What the fuck?” But he was so sincerely like, “Thank you.” “Thank you.” And to this day, like, that’s the reaction I strive for every time I give a gift now. So I’m… I’m curious if there’s anybody in here tonight who has received or given a gift to somebody or yourself that resonated in a… a similar way. Has anybody else gotten like an amazing or absolutely terrible gift? Right here. [woman] My 16-year-old, I gave him lube. You gave your 16-year-old lube? Oh shit.… Is he packing like that? Really? Wait, hold on. That was… Hold on. That reaction was disgusting. [chuckles] Come on. I was like, “Oh, is your son packing so much that he needs lube?” And she goes, “Yeah, he, um…” Have you seen it? [woman] Well, he told me. He told you? Well, what’d he say? [woman] He just said his is very big. Well, we all think that until we… until we play a sport. And then we go, “Oh.” I know why I’m not starting. Okay. Understandable. He said, “Mine is very big.” Okay. I love the confidence. [woman] He was using, like, I guess, soap? He was using soap? No! Oh my. Every guy has been in the shower and been like… [screams] It’s straight in your dick hole. It’s the worst pain. It’s what I imagine getting cum in your eye feels like as a woman. [woman] Naturally, you’re thinking, “What do you do to help him?” So I bought this huge– What do you do to help him? That’s so thoughtful. [woman] I added him to my Amazon account so that he can order it whenever he wants. It’s added to her Amazon account so he can reorder any time that he wants. That’s amazing. Wow. How many… How many times has he repurchased? [woman] Probably five or six times. Five or six times? Oh my God. It’s gonna be fucking calloused. That’s insane. [woman] He’s gonna be 18 now, so… He’s gonna be 18? In two years, he’s gone through five bottles? Where is he right now? At home, fucking starting a fire? [Matt] I’m so concerned. Oh boy. Oh, he’s going to fucking… [chuckles] He’s going to tear a rotator cuff. You got to go easy. [groans] That’s so crazy. [chuckling] Okay. I mean, he’s got a great family. Great mom. You’re by far the best mom I’ve spoken to today. That’s pretty great. Great gift. Great gift. Which actually is a good time right now. For the viewers at home, if you want to pause right now to jerk off… …we’ll be right here. You got this. Come on. [laughing] Finish up. We’re back to the show. All right. What’s another good or terrible gift? [man] Yeah. I, uh, gave my wife a vacuum. You gave your wife a vacuum? [chuckling] As a joke? Or were you like… [clears throat] [man] No, obviously. It was within the first year of marriage, and I thought it was a great thing. Said she wanted one. She wanted one on, like, a Thursday, dude. Not… Not as a Christmas gift. It’s so suggestive. Oh man, what a wonderful Christmas. Who’s going to clean this up? [man] We’re not married anymore. You’re not even married anymore? Couldn’t even sweep up the pieces of your marriage. Unbelievable. So who… who’s this? [woman] Hi, it’s… [unintelligible] [man] She’s not getting a vacuum. She’s not getting a vacuum. Well, can somebody get her some water? ‘Cause that was… I said, “Who’s this?” [mimics woman groaning] Jesus! Just dating. Congratulations, I think. You got a… You got a brace on your wrist. What happened? Didn’t vacuum enough? Netflix cannot put that out there, dude. That is… That would be two specials in a row. [chuckling] I can’t… I just… I don’t want to deal with it. Cut it. Unbelievable. Okay. Vacuum. I can see how it could… how you were like, “No, this is something that I… I remember her saying.” “We need it for the house.” “I’ll get it for Christmas.” Yeah. Good thought, bad timing. That’s… We’ll have to round that up to that. What’s another… What’s another one? Right here in the… in the sparkles? [woman] And one of my relatives got me an African American doll because they didn’t have an Asian doll. [Matt] Oh! That’s pretty funny. What did, uh… What did you name her? [woman] I don’t even remember. There’s these two Black women in front of you who, uh… who were just waiting for a Shaniqua. [Matt] [laughing] That couldn’t be better placement. I’m so happy… so happy you guys sat next to each other. Oh, that’s really funny. You still have fun time playing with her? Okay. Weren’t a lot of Asian toys back in the day. [woman] I got a lot of African American dolls. You got a lot of Black dolls? That’s so funny. I don’t know. Black women, how do you guys feel about this? Is it good… Is it good for inclusion? Or how do you feel about her controlling a Black person? I’m kind of on the fence about it myself. Really. [snickers] But what voice did you give her? Everyone does a voice with their toys, right? I’m… I’m just picturing a little Asian girl being like, “Bitch, you know… you know what?” [Matt] That’s so funny to me. [mocking] Mm-hmm. Or was it… [laughing] Or was it this little Black doll going, “Haro.” [chuckling] That… Either one is so wrong. Oh my God. Next. Um… Eh, fuck it. We’ll go right here. [man] So, uh, a couple of years ago, I got diagnosed with testicle cancer. So my coworkers gave me half a nut sack for Christmas. [chuckles] They gave you half a nut sack for Christmas. [man] A plastic one. Yeah. A plastic one. Oh, I thought it was like a half-eaten bag of peanuts. Oh man. Did you end up losing it? [man] Um, yeah. The real one, yeah. [Matt] No way. Did you get to keep the one they took out? [man] They didn’t give me the option. [man] That’s what I said. They’ll give you back kidney stones. You’re telling me I can’t have my ball back? You gotta… You should get it fucking bronzed like baby feet. Like, you know what I mean? Like… People bronze their little baby shoes or something like that. That’d be great. Put it in a nutcracker’s mouth for Christmas or something. So when you… when you do lose one, do they put, uh, a fake one in there to even it out? Or… [man] No, it’s just empty. You’re just… You’re just turkey-necking it. [man] Exactly. [chuckling] So just the one down there right now? Just like a fuck… Just a grandfather clock. Just… Nice. Now when you– I’m curious about this. When you… when you lose one testicle, do you come faster? Or slower? Has it affected it whatsoever? [man] That’s a question for her. [woman] It’s the same. [woman] Thirty seconds. [Matt] Thirty seconds. Nothing wrong with that. It happens to be exactly how long it takes to get to Mars. So, nothing wrong with that. [chuckles] Okay. What about the amount? [man] It’s the same amount. Same amount. Really? Huh. [man] Just less shots. But… But the same? So it went from like… [imitating shots] To now one just… [imitating a single shot] It shouldn’t be the same. We went south with the visuals real quick. [chuckling] Okay. Lost a nut. Half a nut sack. Those are good coworkers. I like that a lot. All right. The hat right here. [man] Sixty decks of cards. Oh, dude, I did not know you were a guy. I’m gonna be completely… I’m gonna be completely honest, man. You look like a baby-faced lesbian. That caught me… That caught me so off guard. I’m sorry. [exhales loudly] Sorry about that. Continue. [man] Sixty decks of cards. Sixty decks of cards. [man] Yeah. Somebody got that for you? [man] [chuckles] Yeah, my mom. [man] Uh, I’m a professional magician. Holy shit. This is… You don’t have to if you don’t want to. You got cards on you? Can you… Could you do a trick? Can I do it? Fuck it. We’re doing it. I… I love magic, dude. I love magic. You just… What’s… What’s your name? [man] My name’s Gino. Gino. Nice to meet you. You carry a deck of cards with you at all times? [man] Always. Yeah, it’s one of the sixties. We’re at 59 now. Dude, wait till you try pussy. It’s gonna change your life, man. That’s… This is… This is crazy, man. I love magic. It’s like one of my… It’s one my favorite fucking things. I have this whole theory in my head. The magician’s, like… That magic is totally real. My theory is that magic’s real, right? And that there’s like this other realm, like a Harry Potter, but the number one rule is you’re not allowed to do magic in front of normal people. You’re not allowed to monetize off of it. So you see all these famous magicians. My theory is they were like, “Fuck that. I’m gonna go make bank in this different world.” And then sometimes they’re… Sometimes… Sometimes it’s just this, but, um… [man] [laughing] Yeah. Okay, okay. All right. So you… How do you want to do it? [man] Yeah, just name any card in the deck of cards. Any one you’d like. [man] Seven of hearts. Oh, look. I dropped it on the ground right here. [Matt] [laughing] Oh, this is crazy already. Okay, okay. [man] Watch the seven of hearts. Ready? [man] What I do, I bend it like this. Now I do this so you can watch the seven. Right? So it’s gonna go in the middle. [man] Confirm to everyone it’s in the middle. Watch close. You’re gonna see this happen. Ready? One, two, up. Like that. As soon as it popped up, I got hard a little bit. [man] I got him going. He snapped, and I was like, “ha.” Oh, there you go. It’s the fucking seven of hearts, dude. That’s crazy. Want to see one more? Yeah, do one more, dude. Why not? [man] I was so confident that you were gonna call me up here and name the seven of hearts, I put one card in my hat. Shut the fuck up, dude. [Matt] Bro! That’s amazing. Holy shit. Thank you so much. Go sit down. Go sit down. Bro. One more time for Gino. [audience member] Gino! [audience members] Gino! Whoo! When I turned and I was like, “What the fuck,” before he did the hat thing, did he fucking do anything to put anything in? What the fuck, dude? Demon. My… My all-time favorite hater comment is like, “Plant. He must know that person. He had to set it up beforehand.” Have I fucking ever met you, ever, Gino? No. I thought you were a little girl. Never. I want to go on record right now, never met this dude. I… As soon as he was like, “I was confident you were gonna bring me up.” “Seven of hearts.” I was like, now I regret it. Just a little bit. Just so that all night, when he left here tonight, he had to go… [sighs] Show’s over, really. I don’t know… I… I don’t know how, unless I fucking… Their foreskin’s back on. That would be the craziest thing. That would be… That would be… whole show is over. Bro, that’s, uh… that’s awesome, Gino. Thank you… Thank you for sharing that, dude. What else we got? Sir, with his hand up right here. [man] Best gift I get every year. [man] Every year. My in-laws are with me, so bear with me. [man] But my wife does a monthly photo shoot of all these sexual boudoir… [Matt] Hold on, hold on. Every month, your wife will do a sexually themed photo shoot. [man] So what she does… She takes me on a monthly date, so every December I get a book or maybe cards. Um, I think this year it’s a calendar. I’m hoping. Um… Okay, but it’s not a photo for every day of the month. It’s just for the theme of the month. No, no. Yes. So naked photo, holding balloons on her tippy-toes. I wish you guys could see her parents right now. They’re like, “She used to be such a good girl.” [laughing] Oh man. That was the date for that month, was hot-air ballooning, so I have to try to figure it out. Hold on, real quick. What does she do for February? February is my birthday, so that one’s always a little darker, more like… Darker? You know, it’s also Black History Month. You know that, right? All right. What was July? That’s my birthday, so I was just… It’s your birthday? I was spread-eagled, naked in my birthday suit. Just… Just shooting Roman candles out of her pussy? Just… [imitating explosions] Wow, that’s an amazing gift. You guys are fun as shit. You guys have kids? Three. Oh boy. Wait till they find this calendar someday. Man, that’s also traumatizing. Like, don’t put that calendar on the fridge. You don’t want soccer practice written under mom’s just gaping asshole. I’ve never been more sure a couple’s gonna make it in my entire life. This is amazing. There’s romance. Aw. It’s even better that your… that your… your parents are here for this, to be honest. Uh, Mom and Dad? You guys ever done anything like that? [woman] Probably worse. Hold on, hold on. Let’s… Let’s hear them out. Anything of the same realm? [man] What did… What did you guys get for your anniversary? That’s worse. What did you get for your anniversary? [man] Plane tickets to have sex on an airplane ride. [audience cheering, applauding] [woman] Mile High Club. Mile High Club. And did… Have you guys done it yet? [audience cheering, applauding] [woman] It’s in Vegas. It’s in Vegas. There’s just a sex plane? That’s disgusting. Can you imagine getting a middle seat on that plane? [Matt groans] Are there other people on the plane? [woman] The pilot, but it’s closed and he has headphones. But it’s like a private plane? Oh, okay. I thought this was like Southwest Airlines. And there was, like, one bathroom and then just lines of couples being like, “Come on!” “We’re halfway to fucking Phoenix, dude. Let’s go!” [chuckling] This is… You guys are awesome, man. That’s a fucking… That’s a fantastic gift. Good for you guys. All right, we’re going to pivot out of this, okay? If we’re going to talk about presents, we have to talk about how you get the presents, right? Not everybody gets gifts for Christmas. You got to end up on the list, right? Got to make the nice list. Everybody knows Santa has a list, checks it twice. If you’ve been good, you end up on the nice list. You get… get… You get gifts. If you were not nice this year, you end up on the naughty list. You don’t get any gifts at all. I think that’s a very important tradition a lot of us should take further into life. I think at the end of each year, we should all do a little self-reflecting and think back, and say, “Wow, was… was I nice this year?” “Was I a good person? Did I maybe do something selfless?” “Could I have helped somebody out?” “Is there something I could improve on for next year?” “Or did I end up on the naughty list?” Which is easier to end up on. It’s a lot more fun, for sure. But I think we should all strive to be as nice as possible, even if… even if it doesn’t end nice. At least try. I try to make the nice list every year. And no matter what city I’m in for the last show before Christmas, I’ll do a toy drive. I’ll invite all the audience to bring a toy. I go buy a couple hundred toys. We donate them to like whatever the local children’s hospital is in the city. [audience cheering, applauding] It… It feels like a selfless thing to do. It’s nice to do something for somebody else. There’s a lot of moms there who are about to have a lot of free time on their hands. So it kind of skews naughty, just a little bit. I’m curious if there’s anybody in here who did anything this year who might have wound them up on the naughty or nice list. I’ll stay up here all night. [woman] Um, my husband had kidney troubles for years, and this year he needed a kidney, so I tested to possibly be a donor for him. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to because of my own medical history, but my new son-in-law, they had only been married a month, donated his kidney to him. [Matt exhales loudly] [woman] Doing great and living life! [woman] Funny thing is, I don’t know if you know, they don’t actually replace a kidney. They give him a third kidney. So you have… you have three kidneys right now? [Matt] No way. Do you feel more full? [man] No, but I can actually feel it. They put it in the front. [Matt] You can really feel it up front? No way, like a little fanny pack. Oh, that’s pretty awesome. [hesitates] You said the son-in-law had only been married to your daughter for about a year? [man] No, like a… Three months. Month and a half. [Matt] A month and a half? [man] They found out on their honeymoon that he was… he was a match. [man] On the beach in Mexico. Way to ruin their vacation. That’s… That’s pretty– Where the fuck are your kidneys? They’re… They’re… They’re in the back. And they put one up front now? That seems dangerous. You seem easy to fight. Now. [man] Too old to get in a fight, so it’s okay. Too old to get in a fight. I love that. Give me your fucking wallet. Right now. [chuckling] ‘Cause you’re not gonna… No. Now that I know you won’t defend yourself, this is good. [chuckles] Okay. Wow. Yeah, the son-in-law. What a guy, what a guy. Nice list, for sure. Yeah. Kind of can’t get mad at him for pumping your daughter now, right? Like, he saved your life. He got… He gets one now. You know what I mean? [man] He actually changed his last name to… to my daughter’s last name. Oh, wow. So she’s pumping him. Man, took this man’s kidney and his last name. You… Oh, wow. That boy’s going through it, man. [chuckling] Okay. Who else is on the nice list? Right back here in the Santa hat. [man] Yeah, I’m a scoutmaster for a troop in the Phoenix area. I take them camping for over a week, uh, every summer. Oh, that’s awesome. Chris Hansen. Will you come out real quick? Yeah, you want to come out ’cause um… We got him. You’re a scoutmaster. Take them into the woods for a little bit. Every year. Okay. Is this, uh, like… like a Boy Scout kind of thing? [man] It’s, uh, Scouts, yeah. Now it’s, uh, girls and boys, but… Now it’s girls and boys. Got it. Now you got options. Good for you. [exhales loudly] I didn’t know they still did that at all. Now, when you take them into the woods, are they learning any special skills? [man] There’s an ice cream eating contest without your hands. There’s an ice cream eating contest without your hands. Who judges the contest? [man] Some of the counselors. Some of the counselors. That’s disgusting, dude. Yeah, number four’s got it. [scoffs] That’s, uh… Man, there’s nothing but a problem with this. Let me ask you something just based on your voice. Gay? I’m surprised you don’t hold a hot dog eating contest while you’re out there. All right. How mad were you that they started bringing girls along for this trip? They’re gonna ruin it. Naughty list, for sure, man. I know you’re trying to do a good thing, but there’s no way. Not letting that slide, dude. [chuckling] Oh man. Yeah, that’s, um… That’s a police report. [woman] I got one. Nice list. For sure. You’ve got a nice list moment? What did you do? [woman] So we went to California, Newport Beach. We’re at the pier. A mom is screaming, hysterical. She can’t find her son. A mom couldn’t find her son at Newport. [woman] We have three kids. We have an 11-year-old and two 8-year-olds, twins. You have an 11-year-old and two 8-year-olds. So you gave the mom one of your kids. We had a twin. One of the twins, preferably. You’re not even going to notice, you know? [woman] So as a mom, I’m sure all the moms can know, if that was you, you’d want everyone in the world helping you find your kid. [woman] So I ask her, “What does your kid look like?” “Show me a picture. What’s your kid’s name?” I said, “Everyone grab a kid,” because we have too many kids. Everyone grab a kid. That’s what he says too. Everyone buddy up. All the bigs, grab a small. All the smalls, grab a big. [woman] So we start running around Newport Beach looking for this kid, right? [woman] And I see this little boy with a man holding him by the… by the arm. A man was holding him by the arm? Was he holding him like, “Found him?” Or like, “Come on.” [woman] Like angrily. Yeah. [woman] I say the kid’s name, he looks at me, and I said, “Oh my God, this is him.” And I was like, “Who are you?” And he says, “I’m his dad.” And I said, “Well, come with me.” We go to the mom. It was the dad, but they were absolutely hammered, wasted. And I think the kid just wandered off. But we found the kid! Oh wow. No, hold on, hold on. She didn’t find the kid. The dad found the kid. [woman] I connected the family. [Matt] You connected the family. It… It sounds like they weren’t going to make it, regardless. All right, all right. [hesitates] You got the assist. Okay. I’m gonna go nice list on that. Your intentions were in the right place, but also, mind your fucking business. You know what I mean? Don’t you hate when somebody comes over and tells you how to parent, you know? All right. Going back to naughty list, then. You. Right back here. Sitting next to fucking BMX Mike Wazowski. [woman] I would like to expose my mother. [man] Um, so when she was growing up, she contracted, um, polio. So she– [man] Yeah, so now, in her older years, um, she has post-polio syndrome, so– [woman] Yeah. She’s had to have her ankles fused together. She can’t really walk. Her ankles have been fused together? Your mom’s a fucking mermaid? [woman] Uh, that’s a nice… a… a nice way of describing her. That is a nice way to describe her. You could say turned her into a taquito? I don’t know what else… Okay, so ankles are fused together. [woman] So sometimes she has to use a… a walker. Sometimes– [woman] That’s exactly what it looks like! [woman] She’s essentially disabled. [woman] You know the commercials? The sad animal commercials? The Sarah McLachlan ones, yeah. [woman] They have, um, children who are spokespeople for Shriners Children’s Hospital. [woman] They ask for donations. They ask for donations. [woman] And my mother was visiting us and we were watching TV, and the commercial came on, and as a disabled person herself, she looked at these children asking for money, and to one of them, she said, “I want to cunt punch that kid in the face.” Your mom, being disabled, saw a sick kid and said, “I want to cunt punch that kid in the face.” The kid was in a wheelchair? That’s right at cunt height. That’s… [woman] She also thinks that the children for St. Jude with cancer are faking cancer. She said they’re faking it? These kids should beat your mom’s ass, man. Yeah, now I want to see her and those kids go back and forth. “I’m gonna cunt punch ya. Pry it open, bitch.” Yeah, how far is she fused? [Matt] Not enough. That’s pretty crazy. [woman] It’s just ironic that she herself is disabled. Here’s the thing. If she wasn’t disabled, she’d be the worst person alive. [woman] We actually sent in a donation on her behalf so she gets the… she gets the blanket. They fucking FDR’d her? Just got the blanket over her? “Aw, it’s a nice donation blanket.” “It’s fake.” This is a perfect example of like, you know when somebody has a good sense of humor, they’ve actually experienced life? People who get offended by everything, you can tell they haven’t been through anything. That’s somebody who… who… who beat polio once, lost the second time, now has a good sense of humor about it. [woman] We’re all winning because of her sense of humor. Exactly. You passed that down. Passed on those good spirits. I like that. I love your mom. Bring her next time. We’ll get a fucking… We’ll… We’ll get a fish tank up here or something. Whatever… Whatever needs to be done. Who else feels they contributed this year? Santa hat right here? [woman] I rescue donkeys. From Mexico? I’d hate to be a donkey rescue from Mexico, man. “I was getting my dick sucked five nights a week.” “Now you… Now you got me on this fucking farm?” Where do you rescue them from? [woman] Wild burros, right by my house, in the desert. Wild burros, like, they’ll just be in the desert? [woman] Just wild out there, but then… There’s little babies out there. They get orphaned, and then I take them into the wild burro rescue right by my house. [Matt] That’s adorable. I think rescuing is an absolute nice list. My puppy is actually a rescue. We got a little 10-month-old pit bull at home. I love him so much. I love him so much. His name is Hammer. He’s actually got a little stocking right here. Dude, he’s just the cutest little pit bull. I love him. I hate that he’s going to bite a kid someday, but… That’s what they do. This was actually his first Halloween. We got him a little Michael Vick jersey. I’m pretty excited about it. Yeah. Yeah. I think enough… [chuckles] Maybe enough time has passed. Let’s do one more. Oh, right here? What’s up, man? Okay. You could be a Mexican lesbian, for sure. Without a doubt. [chuckling] Okay. I know the people in the back can’t see, but picture it. It’s… Whatever you’re thinking, yes. [man] She, uh, helped a… about late eighties um, early nineties, uh, old lady that was trying to hop on a horse. Your girl helped a 90-year-old woman get on a horse. [woman] It was her… It was her last, like, wish. It was her last wish. [woman] Yes, so… [chuckles] She… She passed away shortly after. She passed away shortly after. How many minutes after… …when you put [chuckling] …this crotchety woman up on a wild beast? [woman] [chuckling] So, like… So she… ah… The person who run… who ran the, uh, care facility was friends with someone that I knew. And they said, “Michelle knows–“ And you work with horses? [woman] Yes, I work with horses. She has a really nice horse. She’ll be able to ride it before she goes. I know it’s a nice thing to do, but it… it’s also second-degree murder, I’m pretty sure. [woman] Well, you have several people with you. So it’s not like– You don’t want to laugh by yourself when she falls. That’s good. [woman] I used to do, uh, therapeutic riding with a lot of people, so you always– Therapeutic riding? What is that? [woman] Uh, so like anyone who has, uh, MS or in a wheelchair, you help them on a horse, and you can grip them. You put people who have MS… [woman] I put people who can’t control anything on a horse. You put paralyzed people up on horses. [woman] Yes. Super irresponsible. You put anybody up there? You gotta put her mom up there. Just fucking… Just… Just sleeping bag it. That’s pretty good. I’m gonna go… I’m gonna go nice list, even though… You fucking… Come back next show, tell me something that went wrong, all right? That has such good potential for naughty list. Mm. No, but I do think the nice list is a very important part of the show, ’cause the world feels so fucking awful. Doesn’t it feel like people are assholes? Like, every single day, the world is so negative. It’s really nice to go around the room and shed light on good people doing good things for others. And honestly, that’s why I fucking love Tempe. Why I wanted to come film a special here. I knew there was good people who had a little Christmas spirit left. So thank you for being a part of that, first and foremost. Honestly, like, this is what Christmas is about. It’s about getting together with your loved ones, your friends, your families, your… your… your colleagues, and putting aside all the bullshit you’ve dealt with all year long and just enjoying a holiday full of love, laughter, and joy. I honestly hope this Christmas you find a reason to smile. I hope you find a reason to make somebody else smile. I hope you have half as much fun as I had filming this special. Tempe, you are amazing. I love you so much. Thank you for being my home for this special. And to you at home, I love you, and I wish you a very Merry Christmas. Thank you, everyone. [upbeat holiday music playing] Sir, with the hand up. [man] I don’t remember a gift I’ve given, but I have one now that I would like to give. You want to give me a gift? Um, not necessarily. [Matt] No way! No way! [Matt] Well, ask her. Be a man. Louder for the people in the back. Will you marry me? Congratulations!

    "transcript":"Michelle Wolf: The Well (2025)Director:Eric AbramsStar:Michelle WolfThe stand-up specialMichelle Wolf: The Wellwas released on Netflix on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Michelle Wolf walks onstage in The Well with that spry, conspiratorial half-grin of hers—the one that says she’s about to say something you’ll regret laughing at. She tells the crowd she had a baby. They cheer. Then: “It died.” The room stutters. She isn’t doing the sweet version of motherhood; she’s doing the unhousebroken one, the one that can’t decide whether to cradle or roast its young. The act keeps circling that contradiction. Wolf says having a baby made dead-baby jokes harder—because now she “feels.” It’s the most honest thing in the set, and she knows it’s ridiculous. Her theme isn’t family; it’s contamination—how decency keeps getting in the way of comedy, and comedy is how she keeps from turning decent. She calls herself “a piece of shit onstage,” and the crowd cheers as if it’s a patriotic declaration. The material on gay men and drag queens could sink a lesser comic. Wolf survives it through nerve and rhythm. She delivers the complaint—gay men won, then ditched women—like someone remembering a breakup over too many martinis, then sideswipes the room with the Dahmer line: you don’t just get the good gays, you get the cannibals too. The audience howls, half appalled, which is exactly where she wants them. When she goes after drag queens, the bit turns into a jealous admiration: she isn’t mocking queerness, she’s furious that they out-perform womanhood. Her politics are cynical but accurate. Republicans, she says, are monsters who plan; Democrats are sentimental idiots who think optimism is policy. That’s not ideology—it’s theater criticism. The abortion material, the “Jurassic Park” comparison, the line about lesbian dinosaurs—it all lands because she treats Washington like another bad sequel: too much backstory, not enough consequences. Motherhood makes her sharper, not softer. She describes the body after birth as wreckage—bones moved, car frame bent, still expected to clock in and smile at Jerry from accounting. Her jokes about breastfeeding have that queasy intimacy only she can get away with. When she swallows her baby’s vomit and says, “Still not cum,” it’s not shock for its own sake—it’s a final, triumphant dare. What makes The Well sting is how deliberate it feels. Every punchline carries a small act of treason against what women are supposed to be grateful for. She talks like a woman who’s done pretending the world is fair, and laughs like someone who knows she can still make it funny. Michelle Wolf: The Well (2025) | Transcript [muted upbeat music playing] [man] Ladies and gentlemen, please make some noise for Michelle Wolf! [crowd cheers and applauds] Thank you, guys. It’s great to be here. I, um, actually haven’t done a lot of standup this year. I took the first seven months of the year off because I had a baby. [crowd cheers and applauds] No, I’m kidding! The baby’s fine! Guys, the baby’s totally fine. But here’s what they don’t tell you about having a baby. A lot harder to tell dead baby jokes… …after you’ve had a baby. No one warns you about that. They warn you about everything else. They say your body’s going to change. You’re never going to sleep. No one, not a single one of you, pulled me aside and waslike, “Hey, you know those dead baby jokes you love?” “Well, they’re going to be a lot harder when you have an alive baby.” “Because you’re going to feel.” “You’re going to have a lot of regular bitch emotions.” “And you’re going to want to recycle.” Most of you didn’t evenlikedead baby jokes to begin with. They weren’t for you. Look, the baby, she’s doing great. She’s doing really good. Know who else is doing good? Me, thanks for not asking. [cheering and applause] You remember me? I’m the one who’s almost always holding the baby. And I do. I think one of the reasons I’m doing well is because I try to be the best mom that I can be. I try to be a good example and a nice person and loving and caring. And I really try hard. But then I also still get to be a piece of shit on stage who tells dead baby jokes. [cheering and applause] And I genuinely believe that’s the balance every mother needs. Because you weren’t always a good person. Maybe the whole reason you have a baby is because you weren’t a good person. But you’re a mom now, you’re a mom now. But who you were before is still in there, it’s still in there. And you’ve gotta get it out somewhere, or you’re gonna put it in the baby. Don’t worry, she’s not even gonna hear these jokes. She’s never gonna hear these jokes because she’s in the bottom of a well. I don’t know, don’t make them so perfectly baby-sized. She learned to crawl, she’ll either learn to climb or she won’t. I do think being a mom has changed my perspective on a lot of things. Like, any gay men here? I’ve amassed quite a few gay male fans over the years. I wouldliketo say to you all, publicly now, we’re through. Gay men, I’m not sure Ilikeyou guys anymore. I’m mad at you. I’m mad at you. When you say you’re mad at gay men, gay men arelike, “Sure you are, bitch.” Youlikeit, you love it. They were grasping each other. Like, it waslike, “We do, she hates us.” This is why I’m mad. Okay, so, gay guys, you wanted your rights. That’s not the part I’m mad about, that’s fair. You wanted rights, we wanted to help fight for your rights. We wanted to help for two reasons. One, because we thought equality was,like, a good thing. And two, you had a great slogan. Your slogan was, “Love is love.” And a lot of us, especially us white women, werelike, “Oh my God.” [laughter and applause] “That’s,like, just what it is.” You guys revamped “Live, laugh, love,” and we needed that. So you guys wanted your rights, we helped you fight for them, and then you got them. And gay men, let’s admit it, you guys won, all right? Charlie, you got the chocolate factory. You got the chocolate factory, you turned it into a weird sex palace. The Oompa Loompas have very different jobs now. They’re not mad about it. I’m not mad about any of those things. I’m happy all those things happened. What I’m mad about is that women, we started losing our rights, and all you gay guys werelike, “Okay, bye.” “Sorry about all that abortion stuff.” “Maybe I’ll take the baby.” “Is it going to be mixed? I would love if it were mixed.” I thought… I thought we were on a really good path towards equality. And then, um, Netflix put that Jeffrey Dahmer documentary out, and they put it under the LGBTQ category. Which is fair, he was gay, you know. Not the headline of the story. That wasn’t the final episode, it wasn’tlike, “And can you believe it? Gay!” So Netflix puts it under the LGBTQ category, and then a lot of people got angry. So Netflix took it out of the LGBTQ category, and that made me really angry, because you don’t just get the good gays. You gotta take all the gays. Yeah, sure, sometimes you’re Elton John, and that’s great. And other times you eat people. Believe me, I know what I’m talking about. We don’t just get the good white women. You know, sometimes we’re Ruth Bader Ginsburg… [cheering and applause] …and other times, we’re the rest of the white women. [laughter and applause] Honestly, I thought the whole thing should make gay men feel more equal. It’slike, look at gay guys. They can lure people back to their homes, murder and eat them too. They’re justlikestraight men. We lost abortion this year. I don’t know where it went. Oh, it’s probably in the alley. Uh… Could be worse, could be in the well. Uh… And we lost abortion. They overturned Roe v. Wade. And my problem with the abortion debate for the last several years actually hasn’t been with Republicans. Republicans have been very clear about what they’ve wanted, okay? Republicans, love or hate Republicans, you’ve got to admit, those guys are planners. They see a problem, and they will chisel away at it until it’s a swastika. [applause and cheering] They’ve been trying to overturn Roe v. Wade since it became a thing. They’ve been playing the short game, the long game, and they finally got it done. Now Democrats, Democrats also had a strategy to make sure Roe v. Wade wouldn’t be overturned. And Democrats’ strategy was, “Don’t worry, it’s not going to happen.” Democrats’ strategy is the same reason you need an abortion. [cheering and applause] “Don’t worry, baby, it’s not going to happen.” Democrats are very frustrating, because they’re the least effective group of people I’ve ever met. It’slikeeveryone else is running a regular race, and Democrats arelike, “Let’s go three-legged.” And everyone’slike, “No, we’ll just run regular.” And they’relike, “Well, we’re in this together, so…” It’s frustrating because they have a lot of good ideas. They talk about a lot of things that sound really good, they just can’t get anything done. They can’t… They don’t plan for any obstacles or problems. They just… And they can’t get anything done. Know what Democrats remind me of? Democrats remind me of that old guy who started Jurassic Park. Because I think we can all agree, a dinosaur park is a fantastic idea. We would all love a dinosaur park. But this guy didn’t plan for anything. He wasn’tlike, “What if there’s a storm… …on my dinosaur island in the middle of the ocean?” I’m not saying I would necessarily ever vote Republican. But I would definitely pick one to run Jurassic Park. They would have kept the dinosaurs very separated. And, if you remember this, one of the fatal flaws was all the dinosaurs were supposed to be female. They weren’t supposed to be able to have babies. But then somehow, they ended up having babies. Republicans wouldn’t let this happen. They’d belike, “These lesbian dinosaurs can’t have kids.” Isn’t Jurassic Park so much more terrifying when you think of it as a lesbian dinosaur island? You’relike, “I wanna go, I just feellikethere’s going to be a lot of rules.” Republicans, also very good, they’re very good at naming things. I think we can all agree, “prolife” is great. That’s fantastic. “Prochoice…” “Prochoice” is so dumb. You just soundlikean annoying girl who can’t decide what to order. You’relike, “What are you gonna get? Mmm.” Prolife is great. Prolife is good. And we can all agree, we’re all prolife most of the day. [laughter] All of uslikelife most of the day. There’s a solid 95% of the day. There’s 5% of the day where we’relike, “I don’t know about life. This is…” But we also know that Republicans are only,like, prolife technically. You know?Like, not in practice. If they were actually prolife, they’d care about thingslike, you know, healthcare and education and gun safety, and… [cheering and applause] You know, they’d care about thingsliketrees. [chuckles] They wouldn’t belike, “Who needs clean water? You can just drink oil.” I don’t have oil either. So they’re technically prolife, you know? It’s kind oflikeif a pedophile called themselves “pro-child”. It is technically true. I’m going to let you guys sit in that. Is there anything more mom than drinking a warm beverage that’s cold? So now we’re living in a world where we have to have all the babies, right? We have to have all the babies. So you’d hope they’d create some sort of infrastructure for us. Because it’s not just one person having a baby. It’slikewe’re collectively having the future, and we should care about that, because, you know, I don’t think right now is going too great. So maybe we should just, with the future, I don’t know, try something different. You know? And you’d hope there’d be some infrastructure. Thingslikehealthcare and education. But alsolike, you know, caring about moms. You know, remember them? [cheering and applause] Yeah, not everyone’s even clapping. [laughter] Feels fair. You’re probablylike, “I’m annoyed at my mom.” [laughter] “I don’t care that she made me, she called three times today about her password.” [laughter] We should… We should, you know?Like… Hopefully we get to a place where we can,like, you know, givelike… have thingslikematernity care, and lactation support, and paid leave, and… [cheering and applause] You know, pretend to give a fuck about women just,like, a little bit. Justlike, uh… one or two centimeters dilated amount. And hopefully that all does happen. But unfortunately, all those things are long-term goals. I do think there’s something we can do in the short term, something we can do for women right now that will almost immediately change things for the better. And that is, you can make us clothes that have some fucking pockets. [cheering and applause] I don’t know who told you we don’t want pockets, but she’s a lying bitch. I bought a blazer the other day. I thought it had pockets. It lookedlikeit had pockets. They were false pockets. I was furious. It’s decorative fruit all over again. Don’t put grapes in front of me that I can’t eat. And men, you’re riddled with pockets. You’re lousy with pockets. You’ve got them everywhere. Your pants are looser, so your pockets are bigger. You got pockets in your shirts. You got pockets all over your jackets. You’ve got… You have so many pockets, you have a pocket for decorative fabric. And you have big hands. Men, you have objectively larger hands. And you’re only carrying one thing. We asked you to get two things, but you couldn’t find the second thing. Even though it’s exactly where we said it was. And then meanwhile, us women, we have very few pockets. And we have these little hands. We have small, little hands that youlike, because it makes your penis look bigger. We have… …these tiny little hands, and we’re carrying so many things. We have our keys and the coffee and a phone and the emotions of the entire family. I know what you’re thinking. “What about your purse?” Okay, first of all, our purse is full. Second, we’re not allowed to take our purse everywhere anymore because all you men were bringing guns places. [cheering and applause] And for some reason that means we’re not allowed to bring our purse everywhere, which is crazy, because we weren’t hiding your stupid gun in our purse. If we were, a lot of those shootings never would have happened. [cheering and applause] We would have beenlike, “Okay, hold on. I’m looking.” “Here, you want this? It’s an unwrapped tampon.” You think they’re very scary.” “You might not want to shoot so many people after you’ve had a snack.” [cheering and applause] There’s a lot. There’s so much for women to take care of and do. There’s just… And I also worry. I worry because I don’t think there’s a lot of good female role models. I have a daughter, and I want her to have female role models. I’m not going to be one. Uh… And there’s not a lot of women to look up to because we don’t highlight women who accomplish things, you know? I said this joke the other day, and some guy waslike, “What about Eleanor Roosevelt?” And I waslike, “She’s so dead.” Like, she’s been so dead. And also, you know, what did she really do? You know, couldn’t even say she was a lesbian. [laughter] There’s not a lot of female role models. I personally love Martha Stewart. Martha Stewart is 81 years old. And she’s… [cheering and applause] She’s 81 years old, and she’s a billionaire businesswoman. And then also recently, she was on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition. Yeah, and see, this is the entire problem. I said she was an 81-year-old billionaire businesswoman, and none of you clapped. And then I said she posed in a swimsuit, and everyone got very excited. She’s an 81-year-old billionaire businesswoman. No no! No no no! You’ve lost your wooing privileges. As soon as she’s on the cover ofSports Illustrated Swimsuit, everyone’slike, “Is 81 the new 21?” And it’slike, first of all, God, I hope not. But also, that’s not the significant thing. The significant thing is that she’s an incredible, talented businesswoman. But no one cares until she puts on a swimsuit and lays down on a couch, which… Anyone can look good in a still photo in a swimsuit. You know what, I need that cover to be a live photo. I’m going to need to be able to press on the cover of that photo and see you get up from that couch. But I think this is what happened. I think people saw an old woman who does crafts on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, and they werelike, “Oh, maybe that means me, a younger woman who also does crafts, could someday be on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit.” And here’s the thing you must remember. Martha Stewart is extraordinary. You aren’t. Martha Stewart is an incredible, talented, hardworking woman. She started her career as a model. She started as a model. But she’s very smart. She knew that wasn’t gonna last forever. And she waslike, “Okay, well, everyone eats and has a house.” …I’m going to get into the eating-and-having-a-house business.” And she did, and she made millions of dollars. And then she went to jail for a little bit of time. And then she got out and she made hundreds of millions more. And now she’s just dipping her toe back in the modeling world. She’s incredible, she’s talented, she’s hardworking. You have a little bit of a mustache. But this is the thing, I think. People, I think, undersell talent and hard work these days. We undersell it because we see everybody doing everything on social media. And I say “we” because I do it too. We scroll through it all day, and people are being kind of shitty at everything. You know,likedoing stupid lip syncs, or those dumb TikTok dances. You know, the ones that arelike… [humming] Then you see that dance and you think, “Oh my gosh, I think I can do that dance.” Yeah, of course you can. It’s a bad dance. It’s a bad dance that doesn’t take any skill. All those people that do TikTok dances, they looklikethey’re not good at sex. They all looklikepeople who give up in the middle of a blowjob. Know what Martha Stewart lookslike? Martha Stewart lookslikeshe decides when you come. I’m sure Martha Stewart hasn’t finished blowjobs, but not because she couldn’t, it’s because you weren’t ready. The other reason I think people got excited when they saw Martha Stewart on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit is because she’s an older woman. And it goes back to all this body positivity stuff, where they’relike, “See, look, old women can wear swimsuits too.” And it’slike, “Uh… First of all, you didn’t know that?” “Have you not been to the gym in the morning?” If you’ve been to the gym in the morning, you know old women can wear swimsuits, and they can also definitely not wear swimsuits. Just right in front of you too. You can just belike, “Hey, can I help you?” She’ll belike, “No, I’m doing good.” I’mlike, “Okay, because we’re just the only two people in the locker room.” [laughter] “There’s just so many other benches.” I can’t smell chlorine and not picture a naked old lady. People got excited about Martha Stewart being on the cover ofSports Illustratedbecause it’s all this body positivity stuff. And I personally have always hated the body positivity movement. Yeah, I hate it. I don’t believe you guys. I don’t believe you guys at all. You’re alwayslike, “No, no, I love my thighs and my cellulite and the way my legs fit into my foot with no real ankle.” Know what you soundlike? You soundlikea closeted gay guy trying to convince people helikes vaginas. Like, “No, I love a vulva and a labia and the way if you turn your head to the side and squeeze the lips together, it’slikeyou’re having a little conversation.” [in masculine voice] “Hey, how are you?” “Maybe tonight we just talk.” “We can share some secrets.” Is it just me or the more I do that, the more it lookslikeit might feel good? That’s for a different show. So there was the… there was the body positivity movement, and then another movement that came after it. It didn’t last very long because it was so dumb. It was called body neutrality. This movement was, some people came over from body positivity and they werelike, “Okay, you’re right, I don’t love my body.” “But I do appreciate that it works.” And I’mlike, “All right, guys, um…” “We’re working too hard here, okay?” Do you want to know the secret? Hate your body and be free! I don’t care if you’re fat, skinny, in shape, out of shape. Just hate your body because it’s gross. We’re all animals who don’t have fur. [cheering and applause] You’ve seen hairless cats. We’re all just hairless cats walking around on our hind legs, pretending that’s okay. Just hate your body and be free. And if you want to look nice… If you want to look nice, you should look nice. You should try, you know? Like, you should get dressed up. But look in the mirror before you leave. Look in the mirror and still find at least one thing that makes you go… And then leave anyway! Leave anyway and go have a good time with your friends who also hate their bodies. [cheering and applause] And we all know if any of your friends don’t hate their bodies, if your friendsliketheir bodies, they’re not your real friends because they have a terrible personality. Like, do you think I leave the house every day and think my hair looks great? Listen, my hair’s doing the best it can. My hair is the same as,like, a stupid kid, you know? Like, you ask the mom, you’relike, “How’s Max doing in math?” And you’relike, “The best he can.” I just hate, I hate all the body positivities. I hate all of it because we try so hard. Women are always trying so hard to look good, and it’s such a fucking waste of time. And then drag queens, you come along, you’re not helping us out at all. [applause and cheering] You’re putting in so much effort, it’s crazy. Like, I see drag queens where I’mlike, “How did you make those eyelashes?” They’relike, “Oh, I weaved three together.” And I’mlike, “You gotta stop, that’s crazy.” You can’t give us more work to do. I’m mad at drag queens. I’m also mad at drag queens. This is why I’m mad. You guys, you guys get all dressed up, and everyone’slike, “Ooh, she’s fierce and fabulous.” Then women, we get all dressed up, and everyone’slike, “Ooh, she’s difficult.” Yeah. Feelslikethere’s a bunch of double standards. Like, a couple years ago at the Met Gala, which islikeVogue’s big fashion event, all these celebrities come, they dress up in gowns. And this one year, Blake Lively was wearing this really beautiful gown, and she ascended the stairs to the Met Gala, and then a bunch of men surrounded her and unfurled her dress, and it splayed down the stairs and it changed colors, and it was this big,like, wow moment. And it did, it looked very, very cool. And then I saw online, all these people werelike, “Um, drag queens have been doing that move for years.” “She stole this from them.” It’slike, “All right, you wanna point fingers, buddy?” “You stole the whole dress thing from us.” “Where you wanna start?” It’slikeif they found diamonds in the Congo and Belgium waslike, “Hey, that’s our thing!” Yeah, I thought I’d lighten up a drag queen joke with a joke about colonization. [applause and cheering] Back the real problem… drag queens! Like, this year for Pride Month, uh… Target, they made these swimsuits, they were for women, and they had a place to tuck your penis. And I’m not mad that that swimsuit exists. I’m just wondering, can we use that as a pocket? [applauding and cheering] Maybe we can have a place to tuck our penis,like, right here? And I don’t know if you know this, a lot of our penises are the same size and shape as a phone, so… And you never know if we’ll have a right or left penis, so you might as well just put two pockets. [applause and cheering] I guess a lot of people are mad at drag queens because, um, they’re reading to children. I wanna be very clear, that’s not why I’m mad at drag queens. Um… I’m not mad about that, and I also just don’t believe it’s happening, because I don’t think those two people are awake at the same times. That’slikeseeing a vampire and a rooster together. Oddly enough, in this example, vampire are children, and roosters are drag queens, because cocks… You get it. I don’t need to explain that to you. But, you know,likenow, I just think a bit differently about a lot of things now that I have a baby. And I’m a little bit of an older mom. I found out I was pregnant when I was 37, so I’mlikean old mom. I’m a young dad, but I’m an old mom. [cheering and applauding] And 37 is too old to decide if you wanna have a baby, you know, because you know how good life can be. I think everyone should decide… Everyone should decide or have a baby in their young twenties. Likein your young twenties, before you have any money, you don’t know who you are, you’re still trying to figure stuff out, every day’s a struggle, and then you see that little baby smile, and it just gets you through. I was 37 and successful. Like, I’ve been on private jets. There’s no baby smile that’s better than skipping the TSA. [cheering and applause] And I wasn’t sure, you know, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to have a baby. I think there’s,like, um… There’slikea bunch of different types of women. I don’t know if you know that. Uh, there’s… There’s not just one kind. Uh… Andlike, there’s, um, there’s women who know they definitely wanna have babies, and there’s women who know they definitely don’t want to have babies. And there’s… And then there’s women who would love to have babies, but who are struggling. And then there’s this other group that I found myself in, that’slikethe women who arelike, “I don’t know.” And that’s when you don’t know. And you either decide to have a baby, or you run out the clock. And so I decided to have a baby. I waslike, “Let’s roll the dice on this.” And a baby’s a wild thing to roll the dice on. You know, it’slike, “I don’t know, maybe I can ruin both of our lives.” “Maybe I can start some generational trauma.” “Give you something to pass on to your daughter.” And once I decided to have a baby, it’s notlikethat went away, you know? It’s notlikeall of a sudden I decided, “I’m gonna have a baby,” and then I was alwayslike, “I’m excited, let’s do all the things.” I was stilllike, “I don’t know.” I just kept getting more and more pregnant and beinglike… And,like, I had a little bit of a hard time with it, because I also,like… I have older friends who have older kids. Those aren’t people you should ask their opinions about if you should have a baby or not. You need to ask other people who also have babies, because they’ll belike, “No, you have a baby too, and we’ll be in it together,” you know? “In the good times and the bad, but we’ll raise our kids together.” I have older friends who have older kids, and you ask them about having kids, they’ll belike, “Oh my gosh, I love my family more than anything.” “Also, today I was on the way to Target, and I was just thinking about never going home.” No, I love those guys. I love them. They got me this necklace with all their birthstones on it. Feels a little bitlikean electric fence collar. Turns out this is a job, I’m the boss and all of the employees, so… Part of the reason that I think moms thinklikethat is because moms love their kidslikea crazy amount. That’s the other reason I wasn’t sure if I wanted kids, because I was scared of that amount of love. Even if you don’t have kids, you have a mom, and you know your mom loves you an annoying amount. You’re justlike, “Get over it, lady.” And,like, I was scared about that amount of love. But then I also realized it’s the exact amount you need to love kids to make sure that they survive. You know, I think if moms loved kids any less, a lot of us probably wouldn’t be here. I think a lot of moms would’ve beenlike, “This one’s broken, we’ll throw it back.” I think a lot of moms would’ve taken that long minivan ride into a lake, you know? Like, “No, have as many snacks as you want.” “You can have screen time for the rest of your life.” ♪ I can hear it calling But that amount of love, it seemedlikeit’s a scary amount of love. And I was also worried because,like, I love my job. I mean, logically, I knew it was gonna be possible to keep doing, but,like, logistically, I knew it was gonna be really difficult. You know?Like, I travel all the time. That means I’ll have to bring people to help me with the baby. And that’s extra, you know, hotel rooms and flights. Then I gotta think about, do I wanna travel that much with a baby? Is that fair to the baby to be going from hotel to hotel and airports all the time? And it’slike, where are we gonna put the well? And… It’s just a lot of moving pieces, you know? And I also realized that I’m really lucky, you know? Like, I got to decide how much time I wanted to take off work and then how much I work now. You know? I got to take seven months off. Seven months islike… feelslikea luxurious amount of time, you know? In Sweden, they would call that, “Five months too early, you idiot.” But in America, they say, “It’s six months too long, you whore.” [applause and cheering] And… And I also got to go back to a job that I love. A lot of women don’t get to get that much time, or any time off at all, and they have to go back to a job that they don’t evenlike. Which is… You have to go back to work, your body’slikea car accident. Literally the frame of the car is your body. Did you know… Did you know your bones move when you have a baby? Your bones are in a different position. You have to go back to work with bones in different places. You’re just walking aroundlikeit’s normal, and you’re back there, and there’s some shitty guy named Jerry who’slike, “Hey, Jill, where’s the data?” And you’relike, “This isn’t a heist movie, Jerry.” [laughter] “But I emailed you the spreadsheets a couple hours ago.” And of course you did. Of course you emailed Jerry the spreadsheets, but Jerry didn’t see them because Jerry’s an idiot. Jerry’s… Jerry’s always been an idiot. But here’s the thing, Jerry didn’t leave to have a baby. So he might not be smart, but he’s there. And he’s not,like, officially ahead of you, But he’s,like… He’s a little ahead of you. And Jerry knows. It’s the only thing Jerry knows, but Jerry knows. So he’s very condescending now. And you’re back at work and you don’tlikeyour job, and you might not want to be there, or maybe you’re grateful to be there, and also that makes you feel guilty about not wanting to be with your baby. You thought, “I could breastfeed here, but the closet they gave me is too small, and I think there’s someone watching.” [laughter] There’s just,like, a lot of emotions going on and a lot of things happening in your head. And I just say all this to say, I’m surprised that more women don’t shoot the office. [applause and cheering] They probably would, but they’re justlike, “I can’t find my…” “Oh, you know what, I put it in my penis pocket.” “I put it in my penis pocket because the cold steel felt good on my stitches.” Don’t get grossed out about that. Don’t you dare get grossed out about that. That’s how you got here. You got here because your mother tore her vagina. You don’t say, “Ew,” you say, “Thank you, Mommy.” [applause and cheering] This is the thing I will never understand. Men, at some point you have to explain this to me, because, you guys, I know. Periods are gross. Birth is gross. But youlikegross things. Why don’t youlikethis? This is right up your alley. It’s literally up your alley. I mean, youlike, youlikemovies where people are,like, shot and there’s,like, blood in the water, and you love when people are,like, blown to pieces, or you love Mortal Kombat. Every finishing move in Mortal Kombat is the grossest thing I’ve ever seen. Meanwhile, some woman’slike, “I need a tampon,” and you’relike, “Ew, that’s so yucky.” You know what, actually, that’s not a bad finishing move in Mortal Kombat, taking out a tampon. [applause and cheering] Your… Your own, not your opponent’s. [laughter] [person] Whooo! I was worried about having a baby, uh… Because also it’slike, one of the reasons I think I was successful in comedy is because I didn’t have a baby. This is a lot easier to do without a baby. I know a lot of male comics, they have families and then they’relike, “I miss my family so much when I’m on the road.” I’mlike, “You should try taking them.” [laughter] “You’re not going to miss them at all.” “And they’re there all the time.” And you know, they talk a lot about, in comedy, how comedy is sexist and misogynistic. And I don’t know if you know this, um, all jobs are. [cheering and applause] I feellikewe only talk about sexism in the fun jobs, but it’s also at CVS. And I have a microphone, I can talk about it, you know?Like, they don’t have… I mean, I guess they have an intercom, so… They could belike, “Um, there’s sexism on aisle… All of them, all the aisles.” And I’m not saying sexism doesn’t exist in comedy, but after having a baby, do you know who I found out the most sexist people are? That baby doesn’t come out and it’s notlike, “I’m gonna split my time between both of you, all right? Ready?” “Mom, Dad, we’re all in this together. We’re a team. Hut, hut.” That baby comes out, you give that baby to the dad, that baby’slike, “Who the fuck’s this guy?” “He doesn’t smelllikeus, who is this?” “His nipples have nothing.” “Yeah, I think he’s going to eat me.” “Of course I’m upset, I think you’re being a little bit of a bitch right now.” “Just the other day, I could feel walls all around me.” “Now there’s no walls, I feellikeI’m falling all of the time.” “I’m freaking out, and then you give me to this guy.” “Who the fuck is this guy?” I think every dad knows this. That baby might’ve learned to love you, but when that baby came out, it didn’t give a fuck about you. That baby will hold you back more than a man ever could. And so you do get away, you do break away from that crazy baby grip, and you get back to work. That baby’s not leaving your head all day. That baby’s in your head. It’s made a home in your head all day long. It’slike, “You’re at work? Interesting. I thought we were having skin time.” “Oh, you’re doing a presentation? I wonder how I’m doing developmentally.” “Oh, you’re in a meeting and can’t check your phone?” Hm. “Maybe I died, and you couldn’t save me because you needed a worklife balance.” [applause and cheering] To be fair, I’m sure men think about their families at work too. I’m sure at some point, you’relike, “That’s right, I do have a family.” “Oh my God, I have two.” “I always forget about the second family.” “Don’t tell them that. They hate that.” So I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to have a baby, and, uh… But I was… I was sure about what I wanted to do with the birth. I was going to lean all into the birthing experience. So I decided to have a home birth. Any other home birth moms? That is consistently the number. Normally one lady who probably smellsliketea tree oil. [laughter] “Use it as deodorant. Use it as whatever you want. It’s good for everything.” Here’s what I will say. All jokes aside, no jokes here. Uh, if you are, if you’re pregnant, you want to be pregnant, and you haven’t thought about home birth or you’re thinking about it now for the first time, I strongly encourage you to look into it because I will say, hands down, best experience of my life. Absolutely unbelievable. It was amazing. You really found out how powerful and capable you are as a woman. And it’s also probably why we don’t encourage women to have home births because, you know… that would be terrible. [laughter] But there is… Okay, so the joke reason why I had a home birth, because it’s funnier… [laughter] is that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to have a baby, you know? And so… If the baby came out and I waslike, “Whoopsie,” I coulda beenlike, “Hey, look at that sunrise,” and then just, you know… “It’s so crazy, a hawk just flew in.” “Does that happen at a lot of home births? Do the…?” “Do hawks steal a lot of the babies?” There’s a couple of big differences between home births and hospital births. Like, uh, at a home birth, you’re surrounded by people who,like, love and care about you and want you to be able to progress naturally and are encouraging. At a hospital birth, you’re surrounded by people who arelike, “Oh no, it’s an emergency.” “It’s Thursday, so we have to cut you open.” So that’s a point in the home birth column, um… But a point for hospital births is that, um, a lot of, you know, most hospitals are plastic and linoleum, you can,like, wipe stuff down pretty easy. And at home, everything’s absorbent. [laughter] So then later, when people come over, you can belike, “This is where we had the baby.” “Would youlikesome spaghetti?” I love to serve my guests spaghetti. And really, I wanted to lean into this. I was gonna have a water birth, I was going to get a birthing pool. I didn’t know this about birthing pools. Do you know they’re just regular inflatable pools? There’s not a special one for birth. It’s just the same one you can use in your yard with your sad family. I was excited about this. I thought it’d be a gentle transition into the world. But I ended up not being able to use the birthing pool because I ended up having a really quick labor. I couldn’t use it because my baby came too fast, which is the last time she’s going to get to say that. Please don’t take my baby. Please. I didn’t even want to tell that joke. It’s just there, and I have to. But this one, I am gonna need you guys to prepare yourselves for this one ’cause… So after I had the baby, I, um, drank a placenta smoothie. All right, well, first of all, we mixed it with berries, okay? So it tasted of berry. But also, your body made the placenta, and it nourished your baby and gave it everything it needed to be born. And then you have the baby, and you have the placenta, and eating part of it is supposed to help you recover both physically and mentally. And I know even after saying all of that, you’re stilllike, “That’s fucking gross.” But here’s the thing. You’ve swallowed cum. And what’d that help you recover from? Your body didn’t even make that. How long’s that been in there? What’s he been eating? But now I have this really great baby. Rolled the dice, came out good. [laughter] I have this really great baby, and now she does baby talk, you know? She’ll belike, “Bababababa,” and I talk back to her, but I talk back to herlikeI’m talking to you guys now. Because I’m a fun mom. So she’ll belike, “Bababababa,” and I’ll belike, “That’s interesting.” “Wow, I think so too.” “Thank you so much for sharing.” Which islike, “Wrap it up,” you know? And Iliketo think she’s,like, telling me about a dream she had, or, I don’t know, maybe something she saw when we were out on a walk. And that’s really nice if that’s what it is, you know? But what if it’s not? What if she’slike, “Damn Jews”? That’s why I don’t talk baby talk. I don’t know the language. I don’t want to accidentally be saying something super racist. And even worse, I have a halfBlack baby. What if she’s saying the Nword to me? I don’t want to accidentally be saying it back to her. She’s going to belike, “I have a racist bitch of a mom.” And I have to belike, “Yeah, I agree with you on the Jew thing.” It’s very interesting. It’s very interesting being the white part of a halfBlackbaby situation. Because, you know,like, I’m a white woman. And, you know, I just have to be on guard to not be one, you know? So we were at the airport bookstore, you know,likeour local bookstore. And, uh… And I think we can all agree, baby books are garbage. Uh… But I thought I’d buy one so she could look at it for 30 seconds before she tried to lick everything on the plane. And so there’s this whole series of baby books that’slike, If I Were a Puppy, If I Were a Giraffe, If I Were a Unicorn, If I Were a Dinosaur, If I Were an Octopus. And then the last one in the series is If I Were a Monkey. I’mlike, “Your dad’s gonna have to buy you this one because I’m not…” “You’re not getting me with this. I’m not showing up to the counter as a white woman with a Black baby and a book about a monkey.” “You’re not getting me.” I think all of us white people know, there are times where we’re accidentally racist, right? I mean, there’s also times we’re very much on purpose racist. But there’s times where a lot of us are accidentally racist. And you just hope the times you’re accidentally racist happen in the privacy of your own home. But I can’t be accidentally racist at home because home is where the Black people are. And my husband, he’s the Black one in the halfBlack situation. You can’t miss him. Unless it’s dark. People get mad at him ’cause they’relike, “You married a white woman, you’ve abandoned Black families.” And I understand the logic behind that, but I just want to reframe it a little bit, you know, as a white woman would. [laughter] I don’t think of it so much as he abandoned Black families as he stopped a white family from happening. [applause and cheering] So he’s really a hero. And there’s only really been one time that,like, as a mom, that I’ve gotten,like, truly furious, and that was when I was buying clothes. And do you know what baby clothes have? They have tiny little pockets for, I don’t know, your worries. And I do… I am, I find myself… I’m lucky enough to breastfeed. Um… Breastfeeding’s weird, though. I’ve always been very supportive of breastfeeding moms, especially in public. I’m way more comfortable breastfeeding in public than I thought I would be. I thought I’d feel weird about it. Yeah. I’ll do it anywhere. And… But,like, I also understand people’s discomfort with it, because,like, even if you support it, you don’t know how to show your support, you know?Like, it’s kind of… I feel the same way as when I see a person with one arm, and you make eye contact with them. You don’t want to look away right away,like… You know?Like… But you also don’t want to make a big deal out of it. You just want to belike, “Hey, look, you and me just walking down the street.” “Two people, and you’re…” “But if you need help, I can help you.” [laughter] I also know you do this all the time. You don’t need help, but…” “You got it. But if you don’t, you know…” [laughter] It’s hard to know what face that is. It’s hard to know how to say that all with your face. I get when people are uncomfortable. In America, you know, because they just care about women so much… They, um… They put those breastfeeding sheds in a lot of airports. I personally have never used one. I don’t think I ever would use one. Um… Mostly because I’ve never seen a woman go in, but more importantly, I’ve never seen a woman come out. Also, I’m almost positive if you open the door to that, you’ll see a guy in there beinglike, “Yeah, I milk stuff too.” But there was one day, I was breastfeeding my baby, and she finished eating, and I lift her up above my head. And yeah, exactly what you think is going to happen is about to happen. So I lift her up above my head, and I think to myself, “One of these days, I’m going to do this, and my baby’s going to throw up all over my face.” And this is how connected me and my baby are. No sooner did I finish that thought than my baby threw up directly into my mouth. It was so direct that none of it got on my face. It was just directly from her mouth into my mouth. She reversebaby birded me. And I was, I was shocked, but,like, I was holding the baby. So you can’t freak out when you’re holding the baby, because you’re holding the baby. So I just swallowed it. And I know that sounds gross, but it’s still not cum. [applause and cheering] It went from my boob to her mouth, right back into my mouth. Who is he? Thank you very much, I’m Michelle Wolf.

    "transcript":"83rd Annual Golden GlobesAir date:January 11, 2026 The following transcript documents Nikki Glaser’s opening monologue at the 83rd Annual Golden Globe Awards, broadcast on January 11, 2026. Delivered live from Los Angeles, the monologue is a rapid-fire blend of roast, celebration, and cultural commentary, targeting Hollywood’s biggest stars, the media, the awards industry itself, and the absurdities of modern celebrity. Moving freely between affectionate praise and unapologetic provocation, Glaser uses self-deprecation, shock humor, and insider references to establish the evening’s tone: irreverent, self-aware, and deliberately unfiltered. Good evening and welcome to the 83rd Golden Globes. Yes, the Golden Globes. Without a doubt, the most important thing that’s happening in the world right now. So, let’s get down to business, shall we? We’ll start the bidding for Warner Brothers at $5. Do I hear $5? Tonight, we are celebrating the best of both TV and film right here in the heart of Los Angeles, where no TV or film has been made for the past six years. I’mNikki Glazer, and just likeWicked, I’m back for a sequel. Just like Frankenstein, I’ve been pieced together by an unlicensed European surgeon. And it’s good work. And just like the podcasters nominated tonight, I should not be allowed to be this close to Julia Roberts. It’s not right. I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It’s insane. There are so many A-listers. And by A-listers, I do mean people who are on an A-list that has been heavily redacted. Yes… And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to… the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations. And the award for most editing goes to…CBS News! Yes, CBS News: America’s newest place to see B.S. News. We needed another. Well, there are so many Hollywood legends in this room tonight. Kathy Bates,Steven Spielberg, yes, George Clooney. Of course, George Clooney is nominated for the movieJay Kellytonight. Yes. Where he plays George Clooney. You were so good. Right? George, you’re amazing. I’m such a fan. I shouldn’t be allowed to talk to you right now. I’ve always wanted to ask you this question, and I know this is unprofessional, but I might not get a chance to do it again. So here it goes. My espresso has been coming out kind of watery, and I’m wondering, is it like a pod issue, or do you think it might be the filter? Could you troubleshoot it for me later? Thank you so much.Grazie signore. The Rock is here forThe Smashing Machine. Yes, there he is. Yes, The Rock is nominated tonight. And luckily for him, the TV showThe Paperis not. So he might win. He might win. That’s a fun one. And Kevin Hart is here. Yes. The Rock’s plus one half. Love you, Kevin. Kevin, I love you. Kevin is obviously nominated for his hilarious stand-up special tonight. I love you so much, Kevin. You’re so funny. And you and The Rock together are like my favorite comedy duo. Such a classic comedy duo. You’re like a Steve Martin and Martin Short, but for people under 50 IQ. You know what I mean? Like, we need movies, too!Jumanji: Next Level. Was it? I’m just saying. I love you guys. Jennifer Lawrence is here. Where is she? Hi, Jen. Wherever you are. Oh my gosh, Jen gave such a stunningly visceral performance inDie, My Love. And you look gorgeous tonight. Oh my God. True story: I once told a makeup artist, “Can you make me look like J-Law?” and he was like, “Honey, I can’t even make you look like Jude Law.” So we laughed. The cast ofWhite Lotusseason 3 is here. Parker Posey, Walton Goggins, Amy Lou Wood. One of my favorite shows of all time. Did you guys actually know thatWhite Lotusseason 3 was the first hit show to feature incest sinceProperty Brothers, season all of them? That’s so interesting, right? Leonardo DiCaprio is here for one man bun after another. Hi, Leo. How good was Leo inOne Battle? I mean, it’s insane. So good. So vaping good. What a career you’ve had. Countless iconic performances. You’ve worked with every great director. You’ve won three Golden Globes, an Oscar. And the most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30. I mean, it’s just insane! Leo, I’m sorry I made that joke. It’s cheap. You know what? I tried not to, but we don’t know anything else about you, man. There’s nothing else. Open up. I’m serious. I looked. I searched. The most in-depth interview you’ve ever given was inTeen Beatmagazine in 1991. Is your favorite food still pasta? Pasta and more pasta. Look it up. That’s real. Leo’sOne Battleco-stars are here tonight. Benicio del Toro, Teyana Taylor. So good. And making her film debut with a powerhouse performance, Chase Infinity. How good was she? Sean Penn is also here, Colonel Lockshaw himself. Hi, Sean. You’re the best. One of my favorite characters of all time. I love you, Sean. You’re such an original. You know, everyone in this town is obsessed with looking younger. Meanwhile, Sean Penn is like, “What if I slowly morph into a sexy leather handbag?” And I feel like that’s hot. It’s good. Sean, I love you. Not only such an amazing actor, but you’re such a devoted humanitarian. I mean, a lot of actors talk the talk, but Sean Penn will actually go to the places in the world that need help the most, and he will do cocaine there. And I feel like we don’t celebrate that. And Sean, I did get permission to tell that joke from your two best friends, Charlie Sheen and El Chapo. So they say hi. Blame it on that. And of course,Hamnetis nominated tonight.Hamnetwas such a masterful portrayal of loss and grief. And fun fact:Hamnetwas actually the original name for Spanx. I’m wearing 30 Hamnets right now. Thank you. Now, we can’t talk about movies this year without talking aboutSinners. Yes. I mean,Sinnerssingle-handedly saved Warner Brothers for about a month, but still. Michael B. Jordan is nominated tonight for Best Actor. So good. InSinners, Michael played two brothers. Am I allowed to say that? It doesn’t sound right. He played twins. He played twins. And I can’t believe it. We got two Michael B. Jordans. When I saw that, I was like, “Nikki B.J. jerkin,” because that was awesome. I’m sorry, Michael. Why did I make that joke? I know your mom. I’m so sorry. I should not have said that to you. That should have been a DM. My mistake. I love you. You’re amazing. Wickedis back withWicked for Money. Oh my God. So good. Once again, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande gave us two career-defining performances. It was so emotional. Two hours into that movie, I was in tears like, “I can’t believe there’s 45 minutes left.” It was too much. I’m kidding. A little long, but I loved it. And Ariana, I would listen to you sing the phone book. Grab the one Kevin Hart’s sitting on tonight. I’m sorry, Kevin. I can’t stop. It’s a problem. You’re the best. And Timothée Chalamet is here forMarty Supreme. Oh my God, man. What a dedicated performance you gave. It was incredible. Not a lot of people know this, but Timothée Chalamet is the first actor in history to have to put on muscle for a movie about ping pong. This is true. He gained over 60 ounces. It’s insane. A Chalamet protein whey. Well, guys, before our first award tonight, I just want to tell you that I’m making jokes up here, but it is an absolute privilege to be in this room with you all. Yes, I’m your host, but I’m honestly such a massive fan. Your work this year was innovative. It felt fearless, inspiring, and in some cases, downright Zootopian. So please keep doing what you’re doing, okay? Guillermo del Toro, keep making weird monster sex movies. And James Cameron, keep making weird monster sex movies. Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos, keep making wonderfully bizarre movies together and go harder. I want Emma Stone playing a piece of toast with epilepsy. You would nail it. Noah Wyle, keep being the only doctor I’ve seen regularly for the past 35 years. Paul Mescal and Jacob Elordi, keep being the same person to my mom. Hans Zimmer, keep composing film scores that sound like, “Oh, what a bop.” And Claire Danes, keep making noises that sound like… too much Botox. And lastly, Steve Martin and Martin Short, keep proving to us that in this industry, you are never, ever too old to still need money. I love you guys. Thank you so much. We have a great show for you tonight!

    "transcript":"Comedy Central Stand-UpRachel Sennott: The Worst Part of Sitting on a Guy’s FacePublished on April 28, 2020 (YouTube) So, I’ve never had a boyfriend, but I have a hundred exes. The way that that works is, you know like, the first two weeks when you’re seeing a guy and it’s kind of exciting ’cause you’re like, “Does he know my last name? “Will we ever see each other again?” I will be in that stage for eight months. And that’s something you think would be bad for somebody’s self worth, right okay? Not with a positive twist. So let’s say I’m seeing a guy, we are both at the same party, and he is ignoring me, not talking to me, not looking at me. I’m like, “I love that he gives me space.” And if we only go out once a month to a diner after having sex I’m like, “This is our spot.” And if it’s been over a year and I haven’t met his family or his friends I’m like, “Can you believe he’s an orphan and I’m the only person he talks to? (laughter) So sweet.” I was seeing this guy for like, six months and it was great, except for he kept being like, “I don’t want a relationship. “I can’t commit to anything serious right now.” And he kept like, saying it and meaning it and being clear and communicative about his feelings. Very manipulative. Yeah. This guy, he also had erectile dysfunction and I would never make fun of a man for anything. They deserve to be lifted up. But when he couldn’t commit it’s like, was it not enough to disappoint just me? So I need a boyfriend because I miss smoking weed. It’s so hard, though. It’s like, I’ve had so many weird experiences. When I first moved to New York I started dating this guy who was like, obsessed with getting me to sit on his face. Ladies, we all move to New York, we date that guy, his name is Kyle, he’s voracious. But I didn’t want to do it, ’cause it feels like the only way for a guy to know how much you actually weigh. But he finally convinced me, which is how all sex should go. So you know, I’m sitting on his face and I’m just sort of working it like a toilet in a public restroom. Just like make contact, back up! I’m checking to make sure he’s okay. I looked down and I see that his face is covered in blood. Yeah. So immediately I’m like, “Oh my god. “I broke his nose with my thighs.” Now I’m crying ’cause I feel heavy. He was like, “No Rachel, like you just got your period.” But I was raised Catholic, so I didn’t even know guys knew about periods. I was like, “Who told you?” And we have not seen each other since. I do think I like, cured him of his fetish though. I don’t think he like, asks girls to sit on his face anymore at all. Even though I’ve had some weird experiences, I do, I like sex, I like sex, my dad is here. Hey. Yeah, I like to sext a lot. Do you guys like to sext? It’s fine if you don’t. Not everyone can be fucking-ing cool. No, I like sexting, but I will say, it does feel like sexting is just calling different body parts big or small. And it’s like I always start strong and then run out of ideas. Like I’m like, “Oh like, me and my giant tits. “You’re gonna f*ck be with your huge d*ck “in my teeny-tiny little girl pu*sy. “And kiss me with your regular-sized mouth. “And then I’ll suck your d*ck “with my sharp, pointy teeth. “A ha ha!” I like kink stuff too. Do you guys like kink stuff? Weirdly, more people into kink stuff than sexting. Everyone’s like, “Don’t sext, BDSM, yes, okay.” Me and the last guy I was dating, we would do a lot of like, kink stuff. He would tie me up, handcuff me to the bed. And I would always be like, “Watch out. “Like, one of these days I’m gonna tie up you.” Flirty. And I finally did it. And once you have a grown man tied up, there are just not a lot of options of things to do to his body. And none of them are pleasurable for you. He’s just lying there like, “Uh, I hope nobody sucks my d*ck.” It’s so sad, ’cause I always like, thought that I did stuff during sex. Then you like, tie up the guy or f*cking him and you’re like, “Oh no, I’m just being pulled places.” Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked* Nikki Glaser hosted the 83rd Annual Golden Globes on January 11, 2026, delivering a monologue that balanced biting roasts with self-professed “fan love”.

    "transcript":"Ricky Gervais: Mortality (2025)Release date:December 30, 2025 (Netflix) Ricky Gervaisarrives at sixty-four with all the trappings of comedy aristocracy—Golden Globes, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Netflix specials that shoot to number one like clockwork—and yet he walks onstage in Mortality wearing the borrowed robes of the persecuted. It’s a peculiar costume for a man who has been so lavishly rewarded for saying whatever crosses his mind. The title promises gravitas, the confrontation with that final curtain that has animated the best work of comics from George Carlin to Norm Macdonald, men who stared into the abyss and came back with something worth hearing. What Gervais delivers instead is an hour of petty grievances dressed up as philosophical inquiry, a parade of settled scores masquerading as dangerous truth-telling. The routine opens, as his previous special did, with a victory lap about the complaints that only made him richer and more famous. The enemies are vague—”elitists,” censorious mobs, people who want to “ban it”—but never materialized. One wants to ask: where are these forces of suppression? In the Netflix executive suite that keeps writing the checks? In the awards bodies that keep handing him trophies? Gervais has built his late-career persona around defending free speech from threats that seem to exist primarily in his imagination, and it has curdled into something tiresome. The stance of the rebel loses its glamour when the rebel owns a mansion and plugs his vodka brand from the stage. What remains, in flashes, is the genuine talent. Gervais still possesses that wonderful physical expressiveness inherited from his David Brent days—the way he’ll mime decrepitude or sexual degradation with precise, unsparing commitment. A bit about Stephen Hawking achieves something close to real wit. But these moments are islands in a sea of straw men. He wants credit for confessional honesty while confessing nothing; he proclaims this his most revelatory show while revealing only that wealth and acclaim have not made him happy, merely defensive. “Whatever side of the political fence you’re on, we should all agree that free speech is a really good thing,” he says, and the crowd roars. But free speech is not merely the right to speak—it implies having something to say. Gervais has been given every platform, every megaphone, every opportunity to wrestle with his mortality, and what he delivers is grumbling about noisy neighbors and imaginary censors. The man who once dissected the human capacity for self-delusion with surgical precision now seems the last to recognize his own. Ricky Gervais: Mortality (2025) | Transcript [audience chatters indistinctly] [applause and cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Thank you very much. Oh. [Ricky chuckles] [chuckles] Thank you. Okay. [laughs] Okay, shush. Thank you. Sh… Uh, uh, honestly, I’m overwhelmed, but shush. Thank you. Um, welcome to the show. It’s great to be back with a brand-new special. Um, my last special only dropped on Netflix the Christmas before last. And in that special, I talked about the previous special going to number one because of all the complaints. [laughter] And the silly cunts did it again. I mean… [laughter] When will they learn? It’s like… Honestly. It’s… “Ban it. Ban it. Ban it from the…” Number one, everywhere. I… My name, like, trended for three days that Christmas. I wasn’t the only comedian who trended that Christmas. Do you know the comedian Rosie Jones? She’s got cerebral palsy, and she was on a… a TV quiz show, and the… the trolls came out on Twitter, going, “She’s not funny.” “You’re only saying that ’cause she’s disabled.” “You’re only defending her ’cause she’s disabled.” Back and forth. But that wasn’t her biggest controversy of the year. This is a true story. Earlier that year, Rosie Jones made a documentary for Channel 4 about her condition, her plight, some of the trolling she gets, some of the insults she gets called, right? And she provocatively called the documentary, Am I a R♪tard? Yeah. Great. Power to her, right. Now, the people who complained were disability campaigners. They had a go at her. They went, “You can’t use that word.” She went, “What? Why?” They said, “Because you’re physically disabled.” “That’s a derogatory term for people with mental disabilities.” “If you wanna use a derogatory term, use one that describes your condition.” So basically, Rosie Jones said, “Am I a retard?” And disability campaigners said, “No, you’re a spastic.” That’s… That’s harsh, isn’t it? I mean… It’s context. She was… She was using it to empower people. She was called that. She didn’t go, “No, that’s not me.” She… she sort of embraced it and, you know, reclaimed the word. So disability campaigners are saying, “No, you gotta be very specific.” “Only people who are actually retarded can use the word ‘retard, ‘” right? But who’s gonna tell ’em? Who’s… You know what I mean? Who’s gonna… [laughter] You’re not gonna go into a room and there’s, like, Bubba sort of… [laughter] …lying on the floor, crayoning, right? And you go, “All right, Bubba?” He goes… [nasally] “Yeah?” Oh, no, don’t. Sh. Don’t, don’t, don’t. It’s a tightrope. Let’s leave… [laughter] [in own voice] He goes, “Yeah?” You go, “You know you can say ‘retard’?” “Why?” “Think, you thick cunt. Just think.” [laughter] [Ricky suppresses chuckle] Anyway, I think she should be allowed to use the word, in context. If she can’t use the word, then I… I’ve used the word now, so I’m in trouble, again. Actually, I didn’t use the word. This is a point I wanna make. People say, “Oh, he used the word so-and-so.” I didn’t use the word. Using the word would be calling someone that word. That’s using the word. I said the word in a discussion about the fucking word. That should be allowed, shouldn’t it, amongst adults? If there’s one thing we should agree on, whatever side of the political fence you’re on, we should all agree that free speech is still a really good thing. [cheering and applause] [whistling] …and it always will be. But now there’s factions of people going, “No, we got it wrong. We don’t like it.” “We’ve changed our mind. We don’t like free speech anymore.” “People who want free speech, they only want free speech so they can go around saying awful things.” Which just isn’t true, and even if it was, the good thing about free speech is people can say awful things back. It’s a really good system, right? And you can’t say anything under the laws of free speech. That’s a total misconception. There are loads of caveats to free speech, all of which I agree with, actually. You can’t incite violence. Good rule. You can’t slander people. Good rule. You can’t libel people, you know? Fascinating fact about libel law. You can’t libel the dead. So I could stand here and say, “Gandhi used to take it up the arse.” [laughter] If I wanted. [laughter continues] [laughter] [Ricky laughs] [laughter subsides] But free speech is the most important human right, from which all other rights come. Without free speech, you couldn’t have human rights. We’ve got free speech, in theory, in this country, for a little while longer. We can criticize the government. We can criticize the police. We should give props to a country that allows us to do that. We’re the envy of some countries. In some countries, you criticize the police, you get beaten up, or worse. You criticize the government, you can be thrown in jail for life. So they flee their oppression, quite rightly. So would you. They flee and they come here. They go, “We wanna come to England.” We go, “Why?” They go, “Free speech.” We go, “Come on in. Welcome. What are you gonna do now?” “Go on a march.” “What are you gonna say?” “How shit England is.” “Cheers. Thank you. Thank you.” That is their… That is their right. [applause and whooping] But I’m, um… I’m too old now not to say what I want. You know? I wanna say and do what I want all the time. I wanna do my favorite thing all the time. I don’t even like doing my second favorite thing if I think I could be doing my favorite thing, you know? My favorite thing is play tennis. I play every Friday. I keep Fridays free. I look forward to it. I play tennis. It sets me up for the week. So if ever on a Friday I have to do my second favorite thing, like three weeks ago, attend a neighbor’s kid’s funeral, I’m like… [laughter] “This is boring.” [laughter] But we all want respect, right? We all want respect, and we all wanna raise our status in society. We can’t help that. That’s in our evolution. That’s group selected from when gossip used to control the tribes, right? And there’s still two ways you can raise your status in society. One, be competent at something. Like, “Oh, he’s a good hunter. Go with him. He’s good for the tribe.” The other way you can raise your status is have virtue. Like, “Oh, he’s not a great hunter, but he’s… he’s wise.” Or “kind,” or whatever. You know? And then, with the advent of social media, people suddenly discovered they could just say they were virtuous. No evidence. No proof. Just loads of flags in their bio, right? [laughter] And they would raise their status by bringing other people down, catching other people out. “Look what he said. He’s not as virtuous as me.” “Look how good I am. Look how bad…” That’s where the term “virtue signaling” comes from. And I hate it when they bring their kids into it. You can believe what you want, have opinions what you want, vote how you want… Go on a march. Great. But when I see a five-year-old holding a placard, he doesn’t know what that says. That’s the adult, you know? I saw someone tweet this once. Someone tweeted, um, “My four-year-old just looked up at me and said, ‘Mummy, why does Rishi Sunak hate poor people?'” Never fucking happened, right? [laughter] But the most annoying thing about virtue signaling is it’s people being smug about having the morality of the age. You’re what you’re like ’cause of where you are and when you are. Like, it’s not brave of me to be an atheist in this country in this year. It would have been brave 200 years ago. Or mental. And it’d be brave in some other countries, or mental. Right? But people say things like, “Oh, I’m anti-racist.” “Yeah, well done. We all are.” We know that’s the way to be now, but it wouldn’t have always been. If you’d been born in a different place or time, maybe you wouldn’t have. They go, “No, I’d have been an anti-racist whenever I was born.” People say things like… They go, um, “Oh yeah, I’d have definitely hidden Anne Frank.” Would you? Would you? [laughter] Anne Frank comes to your door, in the war. You open it, right? There’s Nazis everywhere, right? She goes, “Can I hide in here?” You go, “Whoa. What…” [audience laughs] Just facepalmed Anne Frank, like that. [laughter] “Whoa. Wait.” “What happens if they find you?” “Uh, they murder me, and you.” “Go next door.” [laughter] “They’ve got a lovely big attic, a typewriter. You’re gonna love it there.” [laughter] But I’m anti-racist. Of course I am. But I’m willing to admit that if I’d have been born 300 years ago, and I was white and wealthy, I’d have probably have owned slaves. Because… No, ’cause… I’d be nice to ’em, so shut up. I’d be… Yeah. That’s right. I’d… I’d be the best slave owner you’ve ever fucking… No, I would. I’d look after… I’d dress mine well. I’d dress my… I’d dress my slaves… Yeah, I would. I’d dress mine in little suits. Right? I’d… I’d go… I’d go, “Throw those dungarees away.” “Put a little suit on.” [laughter continues] All the other slaves looking. I’d go… And I’d go… And I’d go, “Right, let’s go to the pub, boys.” Right? All the “white” people would go, “You can’t take your slaves to the pub.” I’d go, “Fuck you, fascists. They’re…” [laughter] “They’re my slaves. I’ll do what the fuck I want with ’em.” [laughs] We’d go in the pub. The barman would go, “You can’t bring them in.” I’d go, “Fuck you. We’re going to the saloon bar.” We’ve got little suits on. I’m like, “You look good in your suits, boys.” “Wear socks. We wear socks with suits.” I go… I go, “I’m buying the drinks. Put your money away.” “You haven’t got any money, but you know.” And then we’re just having a laugh, teasing each other, just bants. If one of ’em got a bit too familiar, I would have to punish him. Just to keep the status quo. If he called me “gammon” or something. Which is the only racial slur allowed now. You can call a white person a gammon. It’s fine for some reason. You can even be ageist. You go, “You fucking old gammon.” And it’s totally acceptable, for some reason. But I’m gonna reclaim the word. You know like Black people have reclaimed the N-word? I’m gonna reclaim the word “gammon.” So I’m gonna be in Carluccio’s in Hampstead, right, with all my white friends, and we’d just be hanging, going, “How you doing, my gammon?” Right? And… [laughter] If our Black friend, Rupert, um… [laughter] I said it was Hampstead. If… If… [laughter] If Rupert came in and went, “My gammon,” I’d go, “You don’t fucking use that word.” [audience laughs] My point is, morality evolves. It moves with the times, like everything else. Just think of that. In a few generations, we’ve gone from owning slaves being legal and respectable in the eyes of God to a racist being the lowest of the low, isn’t he? A racist is the worst person in society these days. Actually, a pedophile is the worst. [laughter] It goes pedophile, then racist. A racist pedophile… [laughter] …is the worst per… If I met a racist pedophile, I’d go, “Fuck the little Black ones too, you bigot.” You know? [Ricky chuckles] [scattered applause] [laughter continues] [chuckles] [chuckles] That’s fine. That’s fine. It’s fine. [laughter continues] They… [chuckles] They won’t cancel me for that. [laughter] They’ve been trying to cancel me for about 15 years, and they’ve always failed. And often, the people trying to cancel me have been other comedians, writing for the posh papers, doing that thing… They always say, “He’s punching down.” “Comedy should punch up. We only punch up. We punch up.” Their idea of punching up, they have a go at Boris Johnson. How the fuck is that punching up? [laughter] The cunt is learning disabled. [laughter] …this fucking waterlogged Gary Busey, fucking albino-egg-man thing. He can’t string a sentence together. Have you heard him talk? He’s like… [mumbles incoherently] He’s a fucking moron, right? I… No, I punch up. I have a go at people like, I don’t know, Stephen Hawking, right? Yes, the greatest brain that’s ever lived. You can have a… He can take it. And he wouldn’t even have minded when he was alive, ’cause he’s… He’s part robot, isn’t he? I think… He’s basically a talking chair, so you can say… …what you want, but… And he was on Epstein’s island, apparently, so fuck him. [laughter] What was he doing there? Why did he want… “I wanna go…” “Why?” [laughter] He’s just there, doing fuck… I would go, “What?” [scoffs] I know pedos who’d kill for a ticket to that. And he’s just taking up a space. It’s probably DEI or something, and they go, “We… we need one.” Like… I would go, “What are you doing here, Steve?” He’d go, “I’m thinking weird shit.” [laughter] That… that is probably a hate crime. [laughter] It’s a big buzzword at the moment, “hate crime.” Whatever happens, someone always goes, “Was it a hate crime?” “Why?” “Makes it so much worse.” Does it? Why? If I was walking home tonight, and someone randomly jumped me, beat me up, mugged me, stabbed me, threw acid in my face, I wake up in intensive care… Beep, beep, beep. I open my eyes through the bandages. There’s a policeman. He goes, “Mr. Gervais?” I go, “Yeah.” He goes, “We just wanna let you know, it wasn’t a hate crime.” I go, “Oh, thank God for that.” [laughter] Pretty hateful, innit? Right? Like… But no, a hate crime is something that’s based on your race, disability, sexuality. So a guy with a gun, he wants to kill someone at random. He sees a crowd. He goes, “Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.” Bang. Kills someone dead. He goes to court. The judge goes, “Why did you kill that person?” He goes, “No reason.” The judge goes, “So you’re not a bigot?” He goes, “Oh no.” Judge goes, “Aw.” [laughter] “Ten years.” Some other guy’s got a gun. He goes, “I fucking hate dwarves.” All right? [laughter] He sees a little dwarf. He takes aim. Bang. Kills the dwarf dead. Right? He goes to court. The judge goes, “Why did you kill that dwarf?” He goes, “‘Cause I hate the little cunts.” [laughter] Judge goes, “You’re a bigot. Twenty years.” Now, he shouldn’t get more for shooting a dwarf. If anything, it’s a harder shot, innit? [laughter and applause] He’s done a… If I was that judge, I’d go, “Wait. What? You shot a dwarf at 100 meters?” “Yeah.” “Fucking props. That is…” [laughter] “Five years.” “In the army. Get him in the army.” [laughter] I feel bad about that joke, ’cause I was reading about the… the tough time dwarves have had through history. In medieval times, they used to torture ’em and kill ’em. They used to put ’em in barrels with spikes and roll ’em down the hill for a laugh. Then in Victorian times, they’d stick ’em in the circus and make ’em do dangerous fucking things. And then, as late as the 1980s, right, I remember colleges used to have events like dwarf-throwing, where they were like darts on a thing. Or dwarf bowling. And eventually someone said, “What the fuck are we doing?” “Can we stop making dwarves do shit for our entertainment?” And it stopped. And now it’s back. Now they’re in the Special Olympics. Now they’ve got a… Yeah. They go… They’re going, “Let’s race ’em, and…” Yeah. Yeah. They’re going, “Let’s throw ’em in the water and see if they can swim.” [laughter] They can. They can. So… [laughter subsides] It needs a bit of work, that one. I don’t know if… [chuckles] People don’t realize how much goes into one of these tours. My last tour, I did 60 new-material nights. Then I did, like, 25 work-in-progress shows. Then I did an 85-day arena tour around the world, honing it all the time. One critic, sat at his kitchen table, said, “Lazy.” [laughter] He called me immature and vulgar. Four-eyed cunt. [laughter] I’m at that age now where everything annoys me. I say this once a day. I go, “Why don’t things just fucking work?” You know? Whatever it is. The remote control for the TV. Working fine. You go back to it. “What… what’s happened in the last fucking ten seconds? Why…” The phone signal where I live in Hampstead is shit. I walk around the mansion going, “Can you hear me now?” D’you know? If you make a phone call in the cobbled streets of Hampstead, you can have five bars, having a chat, lovely. You go one step in the wrong direction… [imitates phone beeping] Do you know why the phone signal’s so shit in Hampstead? Because everyone’s posh there, and no one wants one of those pylons in their garden, ’cause they look shit and give you cancer. But I’ve said to the council, let’s find a blind person who’s already got cancer… [laughter] [scattered applause] Put it in their garden. Don’t even fucking tell ’em. Don’t even… [chuckles] [laughter] But never mind inanimate objects. People annoy me the most. Ugh. I say this once a day as well. I go, “There’s always someone who fucking ruins it.” You know? Like, we were on a flight to San Francisco a while ago, me and Jane, right? We took off, right? First class. Seatbelt signs, ding. Drinks are served. Lovely. Then this woman, about two rows back, she gets out her laptop. She starts banging out something really important. She’s wearing fucking bangles. They’re like smashing against… I… It’s driving me mad. It sounded like fucking Morris dancing. It was driving me… But I know it’s not illegal. I can’t go over, “Bangle Police.” So I just have to suffer in silence and hope we crash. [laughter] That is how I get over things now. If someone’s really annoying me, I just stare at ’em, and I just imagine us both dead one day, and it sort of… Here I was thinking… The pilot going, “We’re going down.” The plane was going down, we’re gonna die, and I look over, and she’s going, “Agh!” and I go… [cackles] [laughter] And the plane smashes into a mountain, and we’re all fucking burnt, but I live one second long enough just to look over and see her totally fucked. [laughter and applause] [chuckles] Whatever gets you through, you know? [laughter subsides] So we got to San Francisco, and we went on a little day trip. We went to this place called Sausalito, this lovely little harbor town. We’re walking around, sightseeing, but about 11:00 a.m., ’cause of the jet lag, we were starving. We thought, “Oh, we need lunch.” So we found this restaurant that was open at 11:00 a.m. Empty, of course, which is my idea of a perfect restaurant. Empty. Right? We sat by the window. We were looking out over the bay. There was a sea lion bobbing round. A pelican landed. The waiter brings our food. It’s… Oh, it’s… Then suddenly, in all that peace and perfection, out of the kitchen doors comes a busboy, and he just stands in this empty restaurant, and he goes… [snorts gruffly] [audience groaning and laughing] I looked at him. I looked at Jane. Jane didn’t even look up. She just went, “Nothing we can do.” Like that. So I’m all alone, right? And the… And the sweat starts. I just get a sweat. I go, “Okay, he’s gonna do it again.” Sure enough, he… [snorts] Like that. I bang my fork against the plate, and I just look at him. Jane goes, “He doesn’t know why you’re staring at him.” I go, “I want him to know. To go, ‘Are you okay?'” I’ll go, “Not really.” [snorts] “You keep doing that.” Jane goes, “For heaven’s sake, he’s a busboy. He’s at work.” “Let’s just eat and go.” So meal ruined, right? And I wasn’t allowed to do anything. So this is how I got through the last ten minutes of that meal. This is absolutely true. Right? I’m eating. Every time he went… [snorts] …I went, “Cunt!” [raucous laughter] [scattered applause and whistles] That is what you get. That is what you get. [applause and whooping] I did want this show to be more highbrow than this. Joking aside, I think this is my most honest and confessional show so far. Not in an Edinburgh-fringe type way, you know what I mean? “Oh, my parents died, so I went all autistic.” [laughter] None of that shit, right? My parents did die, but I’m pretty sure I’m not autistic, ’cause once, someone gave me a Rubik’s Cube, and I put it straight in the fucking bin. [laughter and applause] [Ricky chuckles] I think that is the test. No, um, it’s called Mortality, but it’s a… it’s a positive show, um, I think, and it’s… I wanna tell you some of the things I’ve learned, what it’s like to be me at this age, ’cause I’m getting old now. See? That’s silence, for the first year. Up until this year, people would go, “You’re not old.” Now they go, “Go on.” Like that. It’s like… In fact, they make it worse. They say things like, “Oh yeah, but the good thing about getting old is you don’t care what people think about you.” Well, you should care a bit, because caring what people think about you is what stops you walking around with shit down your trousers. [laughter] “Oh, look at Grandad.” “Look, he…” “He doesn’t care what people think about him.” No, he’s wanking at a wedding. He doesn’t, no. [laughter] But, as I say, it’s a… it’s a positive show. It’s not all doom and gloom, getting old. There’s good and bad to getting old. There really is. There’s good and bad to getting old. For example, yes, there’s more chance now of me having a heart attack, having a stroke, getting cancer, but much less chance now of me ever being raped in prison. Yeah. See? When I was a young man, I thought, “Fuck, I can never go to jail, not with this cute ass.” Right? But now, I’d be pretty confident I’d be left alone. You know, like, I’d go down the corridor, my first day, with my little towel, whistling along. They’d all come to the bars and go, “Ugh.” You know what I mean? I’d spend as much time as I wanted in the shower. [laughter] No one’s even looking. Not a sniff, nothing. The big danger for me, these days, bending over in a prison shower, would be my back going, right? And just crumpling to the floor and having to be helped to my bunk by two big, gay rapists, and they just… …put me down naked and leave. I go, “Lads, before you go, I’ve done my shoulder in.” “Can you… A little tug?” All right? They go, “Nah.” I go, “What do you mean, ‘no’? You’re literally gay rapists.” They go, “We’re not monsters.” [laughter] I’d also be more confident going to jail ’cause I’ve got a bit of cash. I reckon I could buy my way out of danger. Like, the first day, I’d go, “Right, who’s in charge? Who’s Mr. Big?” And they’d go, “Chopper Harris, D-Wing.” So I go and see Chopper, and I go, “Right.” I said, “Right, I’m in for a year.” There’s a million pounds waiting for you if you make sure no one beats me up, steals my food, no one so much as fingers me. [scoffs, splutters] [laughter] I’ve never said that before. I’ve never… Chopper would be like, “There’s no foreplay in jail, mate.” [laughter continues] [Ricky chuckles] [laughter subsides] I’m at that age where I’m glad we haven’t got a Harold Shipman knocking round. Do you know what I mean? Those of you too young to know who Harold Shipman is, right, he is our most prolific serial killer. Right? He killed 300 people. He killed old people. That’s my point. He’d have his eye on me. “I’ll give him a few more years.” And he was a doctor, right? But the reason you haven’t heard of him, right, is because he never appears in those lists of the worst serial killers. And he was, like, one of the worst ever. But he… he didn’t act like a serial killer. Right? He was a GP. He was old school. He had a little shirt and tie, little tweed jacket, little beard, little glasses. He’d do house visits. He’d go round to see Edna, 85. “You all right, Edna?” “Yeah.” “Cup of tea?” “Yes, please.” And he’d make Edna a lovely cup of tea. Then he’d just put in a lethal amount of opioids, right, and he’d just give Edna the tea and watch her drink it and fall asleep and die, and that was it. He didn’t even masturbate. [laughter] Yes, it is a waste, sir. Yeah. [laughter] You… dirty bastard. That’s… [laughter subsides] They reckon he got the idea when he was a little lad. Harold Shipman, little Harold Shipman, he watched his mum, dying of lung cancer, being given morphine. Something triggered in him. He thought, “I’ll become a doctor, and I’ll do this.” I don’t know whether it means that he liked the way the morphine put his mum out of pain, so these were like mercy killings. Like, you know, reliving the kindness. Or the opposite. He was jealous of old people who lived longer than his mum should have. He was punishing them. I don’t know. Doesn’t matter. Actually, it does matter, ’cause if you can really understand why someone does something like that, you might spot the signs in the future and stop a crime before it happens. I always think that when there’s a school shooting in America. It’s usually some emo, right, who… [laughter] …goes into a kindergarten, kills about 30 toddlers, turns the gun on himself. And all the eyewitnesses always say the same thing. They go, “Oh, he was a loner.” “He sat at the back.” “He was shy.” “He was bullied.” Let’s round those cunts up now. [laughter] Do you know what I mean? It’s like, go into a school, see who the bully’s smashing up, right? Go, “I’ll take it from here, mate. Thank you.” Right? And drag that little dweeb off to Borstal or jail or something. Go to the bully, “Go and find another.” You know what I mean? He’s doing a… He’s doing a great job. We need more bullies. They’re beating up future child killers. Every… [audience laughs] You get obsessed with crime and punishment as you get older. I’ve always been pretty interested. I studied philosophy at university, and a big part of that is morality. And, uh, I’ve always been against the death penalty. I was a young liberal, and I was really anti the death penalty. And now I’m an old liberal, and I’m still anti the death penalty, but now I love it when someone gets killed doing something they shouldn’t at the time. Like, you see a bloke in Brazil. A hostage video. He’s got a young girl, a gun to her head. He goes, “You won’t take me alive, copper.” And then the marksman just takes out his brain stem. Oh, I love that. Pause. Rewind. All right? [laughter] Or when a bullfighter gets gored to death. That is my favorite. Right? Particularly when the horn goes up the arse. [laughter] I call that a “hole in Juan.” [laughter and applause] Thank you. Um… No, don’t. [chuckles] [laughter subsides] Or those… those videos coming out of “lawless” New York. You see ’em on Instagram and YouTube. It’s someone with an iPhone. It’s got someone, he’s knocking over this little convenience store. He’s got a fucking hoodie and a knife, and he’s nicking all the booze. He doesn’t care he’s being filmed. He’s gonna get away with it. Then, from behind the counter, comes a little 70-year-old Korean man who batters him to death with a broom. I fucking love that. I can’t wait to be a 70-year-old vigilante. Just walking around Hampstead with a walking stick. Oh, but it’s a sword. [laughter] I’d paint it white, as well, to look even more vulnerable. Right? Wear dark glasses like that. I’d see a gang of youths. I’d go over to ’em and go, “S… Oh, s… Excuse me, guys.” “Do you know where the Nike store is?” “I wanna buy some Air Jordans with all this cash.” And as they go for it, “You little fucking cunts.” [laughter] [whooping] But the death penalty’s not like that, is it? It’s not in self-defense. It’s not in the heat of the moment. It’s cold justice. You know? Don’t matter what you’ve done. You could’ve murdered people. You stand trial. They find you guilty. They put you on death row, sometimes for 10, 15 years, which seems unnecessarily cruel. Then they murder you in front of witnesses. And it’s from the Bible. “An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.” The state says, “You murdered someone, so we’re gonna murder you.” But if you rape and murder someone, you still only just get murdered. That’s a loophole, innit? That’s like… That smacks of misogyny to me. That’s like the judge going, “The rape was free, but we’re gonna…” Just once, I want the judge to go, “You raped and murdered someone, so you’re gonna be taken from here to a place where you’ll be hung by the neck and raped.” “What, at the same time?” “Yes, yes.” “We’ve got loads of volunteers with dildos.” Right? So he sort of goes down like that, and he goes, “Agh! Fuck off! Fuck off!” “You cunt. You cunt.” [laughter] “Okay, he’s dead.” “Yeah, I know. I know.” [chuckles] [audience laughs and applauds] [whooping] [Ricky] Oh. [applause continues, subsides] It might work. [audience chuckles] But the longer you live, the grumpier you’ll get. It’s not just me. It’s gonna happen to all of you. ‘Cause the longer you live, the more shit you see. And you go, “Oh, fuck. This again. This again.” And the more burden you carry. The older you get, the weaker you get, so the burden gets heavier. And you go, “Oh God. This again.” You can’t die nowadays. You know what I mean? You go, “Oh, thank God. I’m dying.” Zzz! “Oh, fuck. I’m back.” You know what I mean? [laughter] They can transplant every organ now. Whatever’s got… Transplant every organ. Not your brain. That wouldn’t make sense. You are your brain. So that would be an everything-else transplant. Wouldn’t it? But I’d sign up for that. I don’t care about this. It’s to get this around. If I could leave a million pounds to science, so when I die… Supposing I died, my body’s crushed, killed instantly, but my head’s intact. They keep that on ice. Wait for a body donor. Some poor bloke gets his head crushed. Put my head on his body, and I’m back, aren’t I? Statistically, I will get a bigger penis as well, so… [laughter] The odds are in my favor there, trust me. I wake up in the future, I see the scar, and I go, “Ooh, that’s all right.” I go, “You’ve always wanted a big knob.” “Yeah, I’ve always wanted a big knob.” I go, “Let’s have a little bit of me time, shall we?” I start, but every time I look down, I go, “That’s not my knob.” You know what I mean? I go, “Oh, that’s not my knob.” “Oh, that’s not my knob.” It’s not my hand either. Carry on. You know what I mean? [laughter and applause] [laughter subsides] I was doing an interview a while ago. I don’t think the journalist liked me. He asked me this question. I thought it was rude. So I gave a fake answer. Right? He said, um, “So, uh, what have you got planned for your funeral?” And I went, “Oh, um… Oh, I wanna be fed to the lions at London Zoo.” He went, “Really?” I went, “Yeah.” I want the… the zookeeper to take out my big, fat, dead, naked, bloated body in a wheelbarrow. Just dump it in the lion’s den, doof, like that. Loads of tourists going, “Is that the bloke from The Office?” Like that. And then two big lions come out and just start eating me. And lions, they start with the soft bits of the body, to get inside to the rib cage. So they’d probably get a testicle each, ’cause that’d be the easiest available… By then, my testicles would be about a yard apart, so they’d be easy… They’d just start eating towards me, like Lady and the Tramp. Really… [laughs] …romantic. So I said that, as a joke, but he believed me. So much so that when he was writing up the article, he called London Zoo and asked them if that would be allowed. And they said, “No, of course not.” Right? So when the article came out, the headline was “London Zoo refuse Ricky’s request to be fed to lions.” Like I’m a fucking psychopath. My point is, you can’t worry about what happens after you die. Live your life. Let someone else worry. You’re dead. You’ve done your bit. I know some people who really are stressed about what happens after they die, some religious people. And they believe in heaven and hell and all that. So now they’re getting a bit, “Oh, have I been good enough?” “I mean, heaven’s great, but hell? Oh my God. What if I go to hell?” And I go, “There’s no hell. It’s made up to frighten kids.” Like, my favorite horror film of all time is still the original Exorcist. Right? First time I saw it, on VHS, right, I was blown away. I watched it again straightaway. I loved it. There’s a bit in that that’s meant to be really poignant. And I laughed the first time I saw it, because it was the idea of the devil being this crass and childish. You know the bit. The little girl’s possessed by the devil. They’re doing an exorcism. And they’re throwing holy water on her. She’s hissing. They’re going, “The power of Christ compels you.” “The power of Christ compels you.” And at one point, the devil makes the girl turn her head round and he makes her say, “Your mother sucks cocks in hell.” Right? And the bloke, she says… He’s devastated. He’s… He’s like… ‘Cause he’s thinking, “Oh, that’s the real devil, so he knows, so it’s true.” “My poor mother’s sucking cocks in hell.” [laughter] If scientists actually found the devil… I was wrong. There is a devil. They found the devil. They… they tested him. It was peer-reviewed. It won the Nobel Prize for fucking everything, ’cause it would be the greatest discovery of all time. And I’d look at the science. I’d be mind-blown. But I’d go, “You gotta follow the science, so, yeah, I believe in the devil.” It wouldn’t even be belief. It would be knowledge. I’d wanna meet him. If the devil actually existed, I’d wanna see it for my… As long as I was safe. I don’t know what makes you safe from the devil. But if he existed, we’d find out, wouldn’t we? We’d… Like, vampires live forever, but now we know a bit of garlic really fucks ’em up. So we’d discover something. Like if you put a devil in a cage with a sprig of parsley on top, he’s weak or something, right? And I’d meet the devil, right, and I’d go for an aud… He’d be there. I’d go, “Are you the devil?” He’d go, “Yeah.” Then he’d try to hurt my feelings. And that was his best shot? And he went, “Rick.” I’d go, “What?” He goes, “Your mother sucks cocks in hell.” I’d go, “Pfft. I don’t care. I don’t…” One, she’s dead. Two, she was heterosexual. Three, she never had her teeth in towards the end, so… No. But it… But it’s hell. Think of all the terrible things that could be happening to her. Being raped by red-hot pokers. Rats eating her eyes. My mum gets cock duty. Go on, girl. [laughter] That has gotta be one of the better jobs in hell. It’s like… Terrible job on earth. I’ve never sucked a cock in my life. I never will. But if I died, and I woke… “Fuck. I’m in hell.” Tortured for eternity. I’d see the first cock. I’d go, “I’m on this.” [laughter] “Not a problem. Not a problem.” I’d be looking round, seeing people skinned alive, I’d go… I’d chow down. I’d fucking… Like that. I’d… I’d be looking over at the big man, going, “I’m doing a great job. Leave me on this.” [audience laughs] And then… [chuckles] There’s the devil with a clipboard, looking a bit confused, thinking, “No one’s ever gone straight for the cock, but, uh…” And he goes, “Okay. Carry on.” I’ll go… What if he then went, “I mean, I did have you down for ironing”? I’d go, “Fuck. I could…” [audience laughs] “Oh, I…” “Oh, I could have been ironing.” [laughter continues] [Ricky chuckles] Who’s getting their cock sucked in hell? That’s what I wanna know. ‘Cause we’re there for punishment, and that’s a little treat. It’s like, I’d be there, right, thinking… Feeling a bit smug. Right? I’m thinking, “This is great.” Not great, but I’d be… [laughter] But the devil’s a trickster. One day, I’d go, “I wonder whose cock this is.” I look up. “Oh, it’s fucking Hitler.” [laughter] “I’m fucking sucking Hitler’s cock.” How is this all right, to do this in public? Because if I followed one of you home tonight and I shouted through your letterbox, “Sucking fucking Hitler’s cock in hell,” you’d call the police. But you’ve paid to hear me say this shit. Fucking hell. [Ricky groans] [Ricky groans] [cheering and whistling] [applause subsides] I’ll tell you what’s very popular, um, uh, in England at the moment, and in America, particularly California. Um, mental illness. Oh, it’s taken off. It’s taken off a treat. When… when I was at school, you were either thick or clever, normal or mental, right? Now there’s, like, a thousand new mentals. Right? It used to be a stigma. People would go, “I’m not mental.” Now people go, “I’m mental.” You know? They wanna… “I’m mental.” It’s like, everyone I know in media is ADHD. They go, “I’m ADHD.” “I’m ADHD.” “Yeah, so am I. I’m ADHD.” “Take the test?” “Yeah, five times.” “Passed it on the fifth.” “Oh, well done.” Right? And it’s like… They… “I’m writing a song about it.” “I’m writing a poem.” “I’m writing a book.” “Oh, well done. Yeah.” And they brag about it. They put it in their CV and in their… It’s got “disorder” in it. When did we start bragging about having a disorder? Twenty years ago, you wouldn’t have got given a business card, and it said, “Ron Pike, anal warts.” [laughter] Keep it to yourself. No one cares. I think… I think the new pandemic amongst the youth is gonna be fear and anxiety, ’cause now we’ve had a whole generation who grew up with social media. Instant gratification. Doesn’t build character. They’re not socialized properly. They can’t deal face-to-face with people ’cause they’re used to hiding behind an identity and an avatar. And now they’ve got teachers and parents enabling their mental illness, as opposed to trying to snap ’em out of it. Now they fear the thing they once loved. They’re worried about the Internet and AI. Young people are really worried about artificial intelligence. And I say this about AI. If it starts becoming a burden, switch it off, right? Like we did Nan. [laughter] Another big fear amongst the youth is climate change. They’re really worried about global warming. I looked into it, and if the polar ice caps completely melt, the sea level will go up about 60 meters around the world. So all coastal areas will be affected a bit, but the real devastation, the real loss of life, will be in places like China and India. So relax. It’s… [laughter] It’s fine. But we, um… We all suffer from a bit of mental illness. We’re all on the spectrum, aren’t we? All got a bit of OCD or anxiety. Like, I’m a hypochondriac, right? Every morning, I wake up and I think, “What’s wrong?” I go, “What’s that? That wasn’t there yesterday.” “That wasn’t… What’s that?” And I google it. I think, “What could…” And I catastrophize as well. So I google it, and the first five or six I’m fine with. Like, it goes, “Could be anxiety.” “Yeah, could be.” “Lack of sleep.” “I didn’t sleep well.” “Lack of fiber.” “I’ll have more.” “Lack of vitamin B.” “I’ll get a…” I keep pushing, and it goes, “Could be cancer.” I go, “It’s cancer. It’s cancer.” Like that. Once I came out of the bathroom and went, “Jane, I think I’ve got bowel cancer.” She went, “We had beetroot last night.” I go, “Oh yeah. Cheers.” [snickers] [Ricky chuckles] [laughter subsides] [Ricky] I wanna end with a couple of true stories, if I may. Um… And, uh, as I said, I think this is my most honest and confessional show so far, so I wanna talk about something I haven’t talked about before, and that’s to give you a glimpse behind the curtain of the Golden Globes. And, um… Thank you. I, uh… [audience whistling] I last hosted the Golden Globes in 2020. It was the fifth time over a ten-year period. I liked ’em more and more. The last one was my favorite. ‘Cause the world changed in that ten years. The first time I hosted ’em in, like, 2010, the press of America fucking… they hated me. “Who is this annoying Brit, insulting the most important people on the planet?” By the last time I hosted, they were like, “Yeah, go on, fuck ’em. Fuck ’em.” [laughter] Because ordinary people had got sick and tired of being lectured by these multi-millionaire… Nothing wrong with that. These… [chuckles] …liberal-elite entertainers telling them how to vote and how to recycle, when everyone knew they were getting free jet rides to Pedo Island. So it… it really hit the zeitgeist. It was always the same deal. “Do you wanna host?” I said, “Yeah, I’ll host.” “But I’m gonna write all my own jokes,” which was unheard of. “I’m gonna write my own jokes, and I’m not gonna rehearse, so you can’t hear the jokes beforehand, and you can’t cancel any.” And they let me do that. I did have to show a lawyer the jokes about an hour before to make sure I hadn’t broken any laws. I never had. I know the law. Sometimes the lawyer would go, “Are you sure you wanna say that?” And I’d go, “Is it legal?” They’d go, “Yep, technically.” I’d go, “Let’s do it.” I’ve never had a joke stopped by the Golden Globes. That says something about them, to be fair. [applause] Thank you, um… [cheering and applause] This last time, they said, “Oh, you’ve gotta see the lawyer the day before now.” I went, “Okay, great.” So I was driven to the Beverly Hills Center, and they’re all setting up. The photos of the A-listers are all in their chairs. I go, “Oh, there’s Brad. There’s Leo. There’s Bob.” All this, right? And this big guard showed me to this room. He opened the door and shut it behind me. And I looked, and there were, suddenly, ten lawyers in suits. Uh… It was usually, like, this middle-aged woman in a jumper. And I thought, “What the fuck’s happened?” I think… [gasps] “Is it ’cause it’s my last time? They’re making sure I don’t say anything…” And they were… they were there, and I went, “Hi.” They went, “Hi.” I said, “Shall I do the monologue?” They went, “Please.” Tough crowd, right? [laughter] So I had the monologue. And I was going through it. It was, like, seven or eight minutes long. So I was doing the jokes, and after each joke, I sort of looked up, and they were going like that, making notes. A couple of the younger ones were going… [snickers] Like that. And, uh, I got to the end, and I went, “Uh, that’s it.” And they went, “Uh, good.” I went, “Oh, great.” They went, “Yeah.” And then the head lawyer, he was about 60 years old, he had white hair, he went, “Oh yes, there was one thing.” Now, I did this joke. I don’t know if you remember. Uh, it went, “The world got to see James Corden as a fat pussy.” [laughter] “He was also in the movie Cats, but no one saw that.” And it goes on. At one point, I go, “But Dame Judi Dench said it was the role she was born to play.” “‘Cause she loves nothing better than plonking herself down on the carpet, lifting her back leg, and licking her own minge.” [laughter] So this lawyer went… He said, um… This is all true, by the way. He went, “When you say James Corden is a fat pussy, that’s just referring to his role in Cats, right?” I went, “Yeah.” [laughter] “Yeah, definitely.” Like that. And he went, “Okay, great.” [snickers] I thought, “This is easy.” You know? It’s, uh… I wanted to go, “Call yourself a lawyer?” Right? And that was it. And they went, “Have a great show,” and I left. And as I was leaving, I saw one of the other lawyers lean in and show this head lawyer his iPhone. And the head lawyer went, “Oh yeah.” He went, “Sorry, Ricky. Can you come back?” So I’m there. I went, “Yeah.” So he had the phone there. They’d looked up the word “minge.” I thought I’d gotten away with it. It’s now like I’m getting told off. And the head lawyer said, “It says here that the word ‘minge’ is a derogatory term for female genitalia.” I went, “Well, yeah, it’s a… a slang word for ‘vagina’ in England.” “You don’t use it here.” He went, “No, we don’t, but we go out around the world, and with due diligence, now we know it’s derogatory, we’ll have to bleep that word live.” I went, “Don’t bleep the word. People at home won’t know what I’ve said.” “It’ll ruin…” I said, “It’s literally the punchline.” He said, “If it’s derogatory, we have to.” I said, “Well, what word could I use that you wouldn’t bleep?” And he went, “Um, well, you could say ‘vagina.'” I went, “I’m not saying ‘vagina.'” Right? Nothing funny about… It’s so clinical. I was thinking of Judi Dench at home going, “Why is he talking about my actual vagina?” Right? I said, “‘Minge’ isn’t like that. It’s like… It’s not so specific.” ‘Cause “vagina” is so… “Where’s your vagina?” “There.” Right? [laughter] “Where’s your minge?” “There.” It’s like… [laughter] One of the younger lawyers went, “What about ‘box’?” I went, “I’m not fucking saying ‘box.'” “Imagine her licking her own box.” I said, “‘Minge’ is perfect.” I said, “People won’t know what…” “If they’re American, they won’t know… It’s not offensive. It’s like…” I said, um, “Kids use the word in England.” [chuckles] [laughter] Right? They weren’t having it. So I went… I said, “What about ‘flange’?” Right? So they looked up the word “flange.” Right? He went, “That’d just be confusing, ’cause in America, a flange is a part of a sink unit.” I went, “Oh, well…” I said, “Please let me say ‘minge’ and don’t bleep it.” I was really rooting for “minge,” right? It was like 12 Angry Men. I was going, “No one’s leaving till I can say ‘minge.'” After about ten minutes, I wore them down. Whatever they said, “That won’t work.” I was going, “Please.” I said, “I’ll write the… You won’t get any complaints.” All this. And eventually, the head lawyer went, “Okay, you can say ‘minge.'” I went, “You won’t bleep it?” He went, “No.” I went, “You promise?” He went, “Yes.” And I left. I knew they would. And they fucking did, right? So when I said “minge,” I pointed. The most frequently asked question I get about the Golden Globes is always, “Was someone so angry about what you said, they came up to you afterwards…” I always go, “Oh God, no.” I wouldn’t even say if that had happened, ’cause I don’t really… I don’t like gossip, to be honest. Right? Um… There was one guy I thought took it the wrong way, right? It wasn’t a bad… No. The cameras went to him, and I’m not in control of the cameras. He was caught in the headlights. It was Elton John, right? But, um, it wasn’t a bad joke. I was introducing Madonna, okay? And I later found out that him and Madonna were in this feud and he hated being mentioned in the same sentence as her. But I didn’t know at the time. I was confused. And it wasn’t part of the monologue, but I’m there for, like, three hours, and now and again, the stage manager would go, “You wanna introduce so-and-so?” I’d go, “Yeah.” I’d come out, and I either do it straight or I ad-lib. And this was a little ad-lib, ’cause I saw Elton in the front row. Uh, so this was the joke. I came out, and I said, “Uh, our next presenter is the Queen of Pop.” “Not you, Elton. Sit down.” Right? It went to him. He went… [mimics fake laugh] And I was going, “Oh, fuck. He hated that.” And I was thinking, “Why has he… Oh God. Does he think I’m homophobic?” “I’m not homophobic.” There’s all this in my head. Then I thought, “He must have heard worse.” Right? In the 1980s, right, when Elton John was in the closet… He wasn’t out. He was married to a woman. Right? He was also chairman of Watford Football Club. And he and his then wife would go along and watch Watford play, and the entire crowd would sing, “Don’t bend down when Elton’s around or you might get a willy up your arse.” [laughter] Which puts my little quip into perspective, doesn’t it? I don’t know how football fans know how to start at the right time, in the same key. Do they hand out sheet music before a fucking… We’re doing “Willy Up The Arse” in C. Jeff’s doing a solo. It’s like… And… What they do, they get a traditional tune, so everyone knows it, and change the lyrics. Some genius changes the lyrics, right, to be as offensive about someone or something or somewhere or whatever. So the tune they used to use, I remember it, it was that old Cockney knees-up song. ♪ My old man said follow the van ♪ ♪ And don’t dillydally on the way ♪ Do you know that one? Remember the term “dillydally”? They use it very creatively in their version, right? So this was their lyric. It was the ’80s. It’s not politically correct. I apologize. They’re football hooligans. What are you gonna do? So let’s… let’s analyze their genius lyrics, right? This is what they used to sing. ♪ Don’t bend down when Elton’s around ♪ ♪ Or you might get a willy up your arse ♪ I dunno. Not necessarily his. But, you know, mathematicians amongst you would have to go, “There’s a slight…” Like, if a thousand people bent down when Elton was around, one of ’em might randomly… Someone might come off a bicycle and go, “Sorry.” And they’re like, “Oh, fuck.” And the scientists would go, “One.” Do you know what I mean? There’s a slight… Also, “When Elton’s around.” That’s ambiguous. That could fit… Like, you could have two gentlemen having anal sex in a hotel room. Then, the next day, they find out that Elton John was staying in the next room. They go, “Oh, I got a willy up the arse when Elton was around.” You know? [laughter] I’ll give ’em that. Anyway. ♪ Don’t bend down when Elton’s around Or you might get a willy up your arse ♪ ♪ He has the nerve to call us “dear” ♪ ♪ We all know he’s a fucking queer… ♪ ♪ He dallies and dillies… ♪ They’ve reversed it. Why? ♪ He dallies and dillies ♪ ♪ He plays with people’s willies… ♪ Again, I don’t know what “play with” means in this context. It could be like… [imitates car engine] It could be anything, couldn’t it? [laughter] [imitates car engine] “I thought you were gonna suck it.” “No.” ♪ He dallies and dillies He plays with people’s willies ♪ ♪ He’s up every arse in town ♪ I’d stop ’em there. I’d go, “No.” That is… That is provably false. He’s not up every arse in town, is he? We can prove that. Right? Take a small town. Take Watford. 120,000 people. He is not up 120,000 arses, is he? I mean, half of them are women, so 60,000 tops. Right? I don’t think he’s been up 60,000. If he has, good luck to him. But that’s not my point. This is my point. It… What did his then wife think of that? ‘Cause he’s in the closet, right? It… He’s… You know? And she’s just married Elton John. She couldn’t be… She’s in love. She’s so proud of him. Elton John. And he’s chairman of Watford. She goes, “I’m married to Elton John, the pop star.” And then the entire crowd sing, “Don’t bend down when Elton’s around or you might get a willy up your arse.” She must have gone, “Why are they singing that, Elton?” And he goes, “I don’t fucking know. Watch the game.” You know what I mean? It must have been awkward. That’s nearly it for me, but I’ve just… I said earlier, I’ve never had a joke stopped by the Golden Globes. That is absolutely true, but I’ve just remembered a joke that I stopped myself, ’cause I bottled it a bit, and I wanna… I think I was being overcautious. I wanna share it with you. So I got the chance to introduce Jason Momoa. Do you know who Jason Momoa is? Yeah, right? So I thought the meta joke would be to show my hypocrisy and my cowardice. Like, I… I… I’m okay to slag off actors. Who’s scared of actors? But when it comes to a big dude, I’m not so brave. So I was gonna go, “I’ve got nothing bad to say about our next presenter, ’cause he’s got a cock like a baby’s arm,” right? I told my mate I was gonna do that, and my mate went… [inhales] “Do you think people’ll think that’s racist?” I went, “Why is it racist?” He went, “Well, ’cause he’s a person of color, and…” I went, “It’s nothing to do with that.” “It’s to do with the fact that he’s so big that he’d probably have a cock like a baby’s arm, right?” So I didn’t do it, and I had a great follow-up. I’ll tell you the whole thing. This is what I was gonna do. Right, so I go out and go, “I’ve got nothing bad to say about our next presenter ’cause he’s got a cock like a baby’s arm.” “Unlike Peter Dinklage, who’s got an arm like a baby’s cock.” [applause and cheering] It’s great to hear this sort of laughter again. You probably don’t notice it as much as comedians, but we’ve had a really weird ten years, where we’re really second-guessing, going, “Is that okay?” Someone… People could find anything offensive. But we pushed back, and we won, so fuck ’em. [cheering] [applause and whistling] Until the next time. They haven’t gone. They’re just licking their wounds. They’ll be back with something madder. But remember who it is next time. It’s always, like, these sort of educated, middle-class, privileged, um, elitist sort of people telling ordinary working-class people what they can and can’t do and say and laugh at, not realizing how important comedy is to ordinary people. When I was a kid growing up in Reading with nothing, humor was like a lifesaver. It was like a superpower, right? Not a real one, like flight, but you know what I mean? You ask anyone their superpower, I reckon seven out of ten will say “flight,” and three will go “super strength” or something, which is great. If you’re a superhero, flying around, being super strong, great. But sooner or later, a supervillain will go, “Look at that cunt. I’m gonna…” [laughter] “I’m gonna get him and murder him.” Right? My superpower, they wouldn’t even know it was me doing it. They wouldn’t even know there was a superpower being used. It would get you out of any situation. My superpower would be the ability to make anyone instantly shit themselves. [laughter] You’re getting mugged at knifepoint. They go, “Give me your wallet.” You just go… They go, “Fuck.” “Oh, fuck.” Game over. It’s game over. [laughter and applause] That’s another thing I’m very proud of. I can honestly say, in all my 64 years, I have never shat myself once, so, um… [cheering and applause] No, don’t applaud. No. [laughs] No! Right. Yeah. [exhales] “Why do you like London so much, Rick?” ‘Cause you get a round of applause for not shitting yourself. [man cheers] Right. But that’s the next phase now. The next… I reckon it’s the next ten years that I will… But as of now, my arsehole has never let me down. Very underrated, the human arsehole. Everyone goes, “The human brain, the greatest computer known to man.” “Oh, the human liver can regenerate itself.” Your arsehole is working 24-7. Even when you’re asleep, it’s like that. “You’re not coming out.” “You’re not coming out. You’re not coming out.” [laughter] “No.” “You’re not coming out. And you’re not coming in.” [laughter] [cheering and applause] [chuckles] ‘Cause it’s like… it’s like a sewer in there, innit? But you’ve got a lovely little manhole cover. Think of that in real life. Walking along a pavement. If that burst… And you know what’s in a sewer, don’t you? Piss and shit and cum and… [laughter] …dead goldfish. [laughter] [groaning] In China. Just the… Just the girl ones. Relax. Just… [laughter] I’m at that age now as well, ’cause I’m in entertainment, people say, “Are you gonna have a facelift?” I go, “No.” Have you seen facelifts? They’re still just that. You know? You go to the doctor, and the doctor goes, “Do you wanna look old or Chinese?” [laughter] Nothing wrong with looking Chinese, if you’re Chinese. If you’re not Chinese, it’s a bit weird. It’s offensive. Why is that allowed? You’re not allowed to black up. Why can you do that? [laughter] Maybe there are terms and conditions to make sure you’re never that racist. The doctor goes, “Right, we’ve done the eyes, but never leave the house in a little lampshade because…” [snickers] [laughter] [chuckles] Oh, so childish. It’s so childish. I hope you agree it was a positive show. It wasn’t about death. It was about life. Some people are so worried about dying, they forget to live. Some people are so scared to do stuff. They go, “No, that’s dangerous.” All the most fun things are dangerous. Roads are dangerous. Alcohol is dangerous. Alcohol is a poison. I should know. I sell it. Dutch Barn. [laughter] Like, alcohol gives you brain disease, liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, mental illness, but it does loosen you up at parties, so… [laughter] Think of all the babies born through alcohol. Yeah. Many of them deformed if the mother carried on drinking. But the good thing about being born deformed is, um, you… [chuckles] Yeah. Hear me out. [chuckles] The good thing about being born deformed is you can start drinking at a much younger age and no one gives you… You know? You see a normal kid drinking, you go, “You little bastard.” You see a deformed kid drinking, you go, “Yeah, go on.” You know? You know what I mean? You’re eight or nine. You’ve had 27 painful operations. You’ve met Olly Murs. Have a drink, you know? [laughter] [chuckles] Well… [scattered clapping] As you can see, I’ve run out of quality material, um… But you’ve been absolutely amazing. Thank you and good night.

    "transcript":"Robby Hoffman: I’m Nervousis the debut one-hour comedy special from American-Canadian comedian and writerRobby Hoffman. Release Date:First aired on February 19, 2019, on Crave TV in Canada.Production:Recorded at the Just For Laughs festival in Toronto. Robby HoffmanI’m Nervousis a deliberately abrasive, high-wire stand-up special built on provocation, exaggeration, and relentless inversion of social taboos. Hoffman attacks contemporary anxieties around gender, sexuality, politics, dating, parenting, and identity culture with confrontational confidence, using shock not as an endpoint but as a rhetorical tool. Her persona oscillates between aggressive bravado and self-exposure, grounding outrageous claims in autobiographical material about class, family, queerness, and relationships. The special rejects consensus comedy and therapeutic language, instead embracing discomfort as a way to expose contradictions, hypocrisies, and unspoken assumptions in liberal, straight, and queer cultures alike, delivered with precise timing and escalating absurdity. Streaming:The full special is currently available to watch for free on the Just For Laughs YouTube channel. [man] I’ll park it. Go, break a leg.

[audience applauding, cheering] Everyone’s a little gay, huh? [audience laughing] Some obviously more than others. It happens. Fellas. [audience laughing] Cuties. [audience laughing] The fellas are for sure a little gay. Especially, right? Especially. Those are your skinny jeans? Especially the fellas. No, every dude’s got a little gay in them. [audience laughing] But they’re not allowed to be a little gay like we’re allowed to be gay. And that’s fair because we’ve been on good behavior. [audience laughing] Fellas, you give us a 100 years war-free, we’ll talk fucking privileges. [audience laughing] All right. The dudes aren’t allowed to be a little gay. All right. But, like, are you guys a couple? Yeah. Right, like, if he told you, ma’am, that he was a little gay, you’d be like, what are you, fucking gay? We don’t want to know. Fellas, you have a gay thought, you keep that shit to yourself. You keep that shit to yourself. [audience laughing] They’re not allowed to be a little gay, but still, they gotta get the little gay out somehow. It’s still there. It’s gonna seep the fuck out. But they can only get the gay out in the ways that are appropriate. The ways that are socially acceptable. Right? That’s why they play football. Even gayer, they watch it. There’s no other way to explain. A dude will wear a shirt with another man’s name on it. I’m not making this up, but dude will– Excuse me, he’ll go to the store, he’ll purchase a shirt. He’ll pay extra to have another man’s name embroidered onto the shirt. [audience applauding, laughing] I’m making this up. If another planet landed here, they’d be like, “Doesn’t that sound too obviously gay?” [audience laughing] But no, that’s what the fellas here are doing. And they’re not doing this in secret. They’re not doing this in the dead of the night in back alleys. They’re doing this broad daylight, Sunday at noon. The fellas in this country wake up Sunday at noon with a pep in their step. [audience laughing] Throw on a shirt with another man’s name on it. Run down the stairs hard as a rock, ready to watch this shit. [audience applauding, cheering] This is the state. Every dude’s got a little gay in ’em. Just like every dude’s got a little pedophilia in them. Huh? That took a fucking turn, didn’t it? That took a motherfucking turn. Ah, you like ’em young? Show of hands, who here… who here likes a tight puss? Show of hands. What, you like a loose puss? Exactly. The problem with the fellas is they’re never upfront about who they are. We always have to catch them. That’s why we have the issues. We have to catch them. They never just tell us. They never just tell us, like, “You know, occasionally I suck a dick, and…” [audience laughing] “Every so often I like a teenager.” “Okay, thank you. Thank you for being honest.” “Let’s work with– Let’s go from there.” [audience laughing] We have to catch them. They’re not mad about who the fuck they are. Right? Like, at least I’m man enough to say, “You got me. I’m gay.” It is what it is. You see what’s going on with the outfit. I’m not pulling a fast one on anyone, right? So who’s gonna be man enough tonight? [audience laughing] Who is going to be man enough tonight for Netflix and the world to admit to me they like kids? Who’s it gonna be? Who’s it gonna be? Thank you, sir in the baseball cap. I appreciate that. Thank you. Give it up for the pedophile in the eighth row. I appreciate that. I do. One pedophile down, two to go. It being LA, could be six. I don’t want to alarm. I don’t want to alarm. By the way, you only got a little bit pedophile. It’s like you’re not– 95% greatest guy in the world. I don’t know, right? 95% could be the greatest guy in the world. 5% jail. That is the makeup of any man. That is the makeup of a man, right? 95% is a great partner, is a great father. He’s a great contributor. He– 5% “I didn’t know how young she was.” [audience laughing] My favorite is like, “Well, she was at the club.” [audience laughing] She was at the venue. She was at a location. This is a defense. “Well, the club let her…” “What am I to do as a man? They let the nine-year-old in.” “What am I to do as a man?” I’m going to go, “You know what? He’s got a point.” [sighs] No, pedophiles get a bad rap. [laughs] [audience laughing] Oh, I’m not saying I feel bad for them. I’m not saying I feel bad for them, okay, pedophiles. Pedophiles get a bad rap. Nobody has nothing good to say about them. I mean, I’m sure some of them are fine people. They volunteer. I don’t know the community. Okay? Nobody has, you know, nothing good to say about pedophiles. I understand that. I agree with you. Okay? Even for the sake of the joke, I was trying to think, like, “What’s even a good thing you could call a pedophile?” Just as a writing exercise, what’s even– What, like a priest? I don’t know. I’m just… [audience applauding, laughing] I’m… I’m just spitballing. I’m just spitballing here, right? What, like a president? I don’t know, right? I was– I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. Ultimately, nobody has nothing good to say about pedophiles, and I agree. I agree, but… [smacks lips] …what about all these kids? [audience laughing] Into the pedophiles, huh? [audience laughing] What about all these sicko kids into these fucking grown-ups. They’re getting away scot-free? Not on my watch. I had some kid jump up on me last week. I said, “Get the fuck off of me!” [audience laughing] I don’t swing that way. All I’m saying is, there’s two sides to every– No, I… [audience applauding] But it’s tough to hear about all this stuff all the time, you know? And, you know, like, I’ve noticed that nobody’s ever tried to sex-traffic me, and I’m trying not to take it so personal. [audience laughing] I’m trying not to take it, but just the sheer level that you hear of this happening, just the sheer volume of this operation. What, nobody wants me on an island? [audience laughing] This does nothing for the billionaires? I got an enlarged clitoris. Are you getting this in? Are you getting this in? And the hot girls, they get mad. Calm down. Okay? Uncross your arms. Calm down. Calm, okay? I’m not competing. Okay, the hot girls, they get mad at me, okay? Okay, they get mad at me. Calm down. I’m not… I’m not saying I’m your hottest girl on this island. Okay? I’m not saying I’m your A-tier. I don’t even think I’m your B-level girl on this island. I’m talking, those girls, they’re on break. Right? They’re on break. Right? That’s when you bring this dyke out for a tug. Is that what the fella’s like, or what? Do I know? Do I know? Right, a little cinch at the end. I call that the zip tie. That’s a good move. No, I give a hand job like a Bop It. [laughs] Remember? The Bop It. Squeeze it, pull it, bop it. The fellas love that. I’m telling you right now. Don’t I know it? The fellas love– If there’s one thing I know about the fellas, they love spontaneity. The Bop It is for you. I’m telling you now. Any couples together a long time? Any coup– Right? Right? You gotta keep it spicy. You– The Bop It is for you. I’m telling you. I am telling you. Right? You get home from the show tonight, you… you dust off the old handy, he’ll never know what hit him. Right? You’re going in on him, you’re going in on him, he’s about to come, he’s about to come. “No, you don’t.” Bop it! “The fuck you are.” [audience applauding] “The fuck you are.” [audience laughing] I’m telling you, ladies, this is the move. I’m here to help. This is the move. You know, it works. I… I see Mormons sometimes, right? I go– Right, Mormons, it’s good for them too, right? They can’t do nothing. Right? You hit them with the bop it, “Gonna come, gonna come.” “No, you don’t. The fuck back in there.” “Jesus didn’t see shit.” Nothing happened. [audience applauding, cheering] For the closeted gay… Guys, how are you gonna be gay if you didn’t come? Make it make sense. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. But for me, it’s like any issue you pluck, it’s the worst thing. So it doesn’t matter, like, you know, like sex traffic, I never even heard about it till two years. You know, I didn’t even know that was a kind of traffic. Like, to me, I’m still stuck on traffic traffic, you know what I mean? I’m still like, that’s a major problem, like, right? Like, I don’t… I can’t be splitting my attention right now. We haven’t handled the first type of traffic. I’m at… I’m at a point, and that’s what I did in LA, I’m at a point, and we know this in LA, I’m at a point, and I’m talking standstill, when I’m in gridlock traffic like only we know. Right, when I’m in gridlock traffic, I’m gonna need a pileup at the end of that. [audience laughing, applauding] [woman] Yeah! That’s where I’m at emotionally speaking. Right, like, if you’re gonna add 27 minutes. [audience laughing] You’re gonna add 27 minutes to my route, I better see a dead child flung from the windshield Ideally, the ambulance has already arrived at the scene. You better give me someone to look at when I fucking pull through. This is Hollywood, baby. Paint me a picture. [audience laughing] If there is a God, and if there is a God… [laughs] just when I’m… just when I’m pulling through, just as I’m getting through the bottleneck, the child is pronounced dead at the scene. [audience laughing] Let’s end properly. The child’s pronounced– This is– Twenty-eight minutes? Dead twins. The price goes up, bitch. This is America. Nothing is free. [audience laughing] I want to get their paint, and say, I want them doing “Clear.” Right, they never do “Clear” anymore. What happened to fucking “Clear”? “Clear, we don’t know, clear.” [audience laughing] Bring fucking “Clear” back. Now we just let people die. Not even clearing people anymore. It’s just, it’s all like, it’s all like so bad, like all the issues. Like, okay, is this like a, is this like a pro-choice type crowd? [audience applauding, cheering] Uh-oh. [laughs] [audience laughing] It ain’t right. [laughs] I don’t know. It ain’t right. [audience laughing] We know it ain’t right. No, I’m kidding. Dykes, we sat out on this shit, didn’t we? We said, “Straights, this one’s on you.” “If you’re making kids, you’re breeding, come on.” “Can’t you figure out your own shit once in a while?” We’re a small community. We’re a small community because every time I like dip into the straight world, I’m like, “They’re still on that?!” Like, we’ve had progress. I got married. They’re still on this? Fuck, I guess they do need help. Like, time to get a dyke on the case. Fee-fi-fo-fum, here I fucking come. [audience cheering] Because I was like feeling bad. I was like, “Well, Rob, just ’cause something doesn’t affect you, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know about it.” Right, like, do you guys agree it’s important to be informed about the issues? Right? Like, it’s important to be informed about the issues, right? So I thought, “All right, let me look this shit up.” “What is abortion?” Let’s see what these straights are even crying about. [audience laughing] I decided to get home, look this shit up, ask Jeeves, what is… [audience laughing] …abortion? What is it? We can discuss this tonight. What is abortion? You know, I’m a firm believer comedy should keep it light. People know this about me. [audience laughing] Okay, let’s just keep it light, right? Let’s just discuss this tonight. What is abortion? Let’s not ruffle any feathers, okay? We can discuss it tonight. What is abortion? It’s… killing a baby. [chuckles] And that’s okay. [audience laughing] So perfect, it’s killing a baby, and that’s okay. Some people get stuck on that already. They don’t know if it’s a baby or not, and I’m not an economist, so I don’t know. You know, I’ve been wrong before. Could be a cantaloupe. I feel like it’s gonna be a baby. And we’re killing that baby, and that’s okay. In fact, I give a mother till ten… [audience laughing] …to kill her baby. What I realized is the straights, this is why they can’t figure nothing out. It takes forever. They’re thinking about– They don’t know how to think about their issues. They’re going about it wrong, right? They’re focused on the wrong things. They get stuck in the weeds. The fine print. Right? They’re debating stupid shit like “At 16 weeks, is it developed?” “At 20 weeks, is it developed?” “Is a five-year-old developed?” No, that’s why I give till ten, just in case. [audience laughing] A bitch can clock her nine-year-old in the head. I don’t say shit. [audience laughing] Because did you see how he was talking to her? Exactly, turn around, mind your business, there’s an abortion happening… [audience laughing] …over here. People can be so rude. [audience laughing] Can’t you give the woman some privacy? It’s a difficult decision to abort a nine-year-old. My God. Have some compassion. No, the straights, they can’t solve nothing because they don’t know how to think about their issues. They don’t know how to go about their issues, right? They’re debating things like, “Four months, late-term abortion, nine months…” Nine months? I’m thinking the future. Society at large. We raise the age of abortion till ten. We got a lot of well-fucking-behaved kids on our hands that way. [audience applauding] A lot of made beds in the morning. A lot of help bringing the groceries into the car. Let’s make kids worth saving. How’s that for an idea? Late-late-stage abortion. Who’s with me? [audience applauding, cheering] So weird. Like, everything’s kind of, like, flipped now. Like… [inhales, exhales] Straight people fighting for the right not to have a baby, and… [sighs] I hate gay people with kids. I don’t know. [laughs] [audience laughing] Gay people having kids? What are we doing? [audience laughing] That was the whole point. [audience laughing] How do you ruin being gay? That was the one thing we got. That was the one silver lining. [audience laughing] We signed that deal, right? In the 80s, our forefathers, they went out. They were like, “Be gay, get fucked, get AIDS. No kids.” “We signed that deal.” People died for these rights. [audience laughing] It’s not just that gay people are having kids. It’s that they want their own biological kids. Right? I know fags and dykes getting together and mixing their shit up. “God doesn’t like us. We’re gonna be God.” What is going on? Right? Like… like, we forget. Like, we had an understanding with society. We forget we had an understanding with society. Right? At some point, society let us be gay. Fantastic. Thank you so much. [laughs] At some point, society was like, “You get to be gay, but… but you got to adopt all these loose fucking kids.” That was the pitch. [laughs] That was the pitch. That was the whole idea. It was like making lemonade out of lemons. It was natural. It was organic. It’s like, “We can’t have kids. They can’t have parents.” “Let’s fucking go.” [audience applauding, laughing] Right? Like, obviously, people would still think it’s weird we’re gay. Right? So people would still be like, “It’s kinda weird that they’re gay, but at least they’re cleaning up all these fucking loosies.” [audience laughing] Who just wants loose kids running around? You ever in a parking lot, somebody’s kid, I’m like, “Whose fucking kid is this?” [audience laughing] Because as a kid, I remember being… sad. I was like… [exhales] “What if I grow up and I’m still gay?” It wasn’t looking good. In the mirror in my brother Menachem’s pants, “But they look so sick though.” [audience laughing] “Oh yeah, I might have to take these. This shit’s mine now.” But I was sad. I remember being a kid, and I was sad. I was like, “What if you grow up and you’re still gay?” And you want a family, you want kids. I was too young to decide. I came from such a large family. I was like, “What if you want a family, you want kids?” And then I remember being, like, relieved. I was like, “Oh yeah.” “I actually heard about this.” “I actually think I just heard about this.” If you grow up and you’re gay, you want a family, you want kids, at some point, they’ll throw you, like, a 9-year-old. “This is Tony. Look at that.” [audience laughing] “Wow, isn’t that fantastic?” “He’s got all his shots. He’s moving ready. I love that.” He’s potty-trained. Turnkey Tony, that’s just terrific. “What a cutie, what a cutie.” [audience applauding, laughing] And if, like, a few years later, your wife wanted another kid or whatever, they give you like a 15-year-old. Of course, he’s got severe anger management issues, as you can imagine. Twice the size of me. I could die at any moment. [audience laughing] But this is Tony and Miguel. These are my sons. These are my sons. Right? That’s what the gay American family was supposed to be. That’s what the gay American family was supposed to look like. A dyke and her sons. [audience laughing, cheering] Never mind I got the Menendez brothers. [laughing] I could die at any… [audience laughing] You know I’m going to raise men out of these boys. [laughs] I got Rogan playing all day. No pussy shit… [audience laughing] …in this house. Right? And the fags, the fags, they’re going to adopt all the loose little girls. Right? All the girls go to the gay dads. Right? These girls are fucking decked. You’ve never seen hotter girls… …in your life, right? Girls’ prom comes around, gay daddy’s making the dress him-fucking-self. [audience laughing] Other gay daddy’s at the florist. He’s stressed. “The corsage better match perfect.” You’ve never seen hotter girls than the girls who walk out of the house with the two gay dads. Yeah. Dykes, we were gonna raise men out of these boys. And the fags, they’re gonna raise women out of these girls. So while you’re all raising your they, thems, whatever the fuck you’ve done with your own kids, [scattered applause, cheering] we’re gonna raise men and women once again. [audience applauding, cheering] Don’t… don’t even worry about it. These gays will straighten this whole mess out. Don’t you even. My parents were straight. For shame. They let me leave the house looking like this. Call CPS. Terrible with these straight parents making gays and theys and queers. This is terrible. [audience laughing] [laughs] You know, it’s okay. I grew up really bad. I grew up really bad. I’m starting to realize the extent of how, you know, bad I grew up in many ways. Right? Like, you ever realize you grow up poor ’cause you like a hard towel? [audience laughing] This is the shit now, right? Like, I’m starting to be friends with richer people now. I went to somebody’s house. They have a pool. And they gave me a towel. First of all, I brought my own towel. I was like… [audience laughing] …embarrassed. I was like, “Okay, they got the towels.” It’s poor to bring your own towel. Who– [audience laughing] Nobody else but me showed up with a fucking towel. I had a whole bag. [audience laughing] And she gives me the towel, and it’s like fluffy. Right? And I tried to use the towel, and I was like, “I feel like I’m still wet.” Like… Am I… Am I supposed to dry the towel? Is the towel drying me? Like, what’s the process on the fluffy towel? And she goes, “Oh, we just got new towels.” I was like, “New towels?” Like, to me, new and towel. Like, to me, seeing “new” and “towel” together, like, I can’t even… Like, they’re selling these? [chuckles] To me, a towel is, like, built with the house, like… [audience laughing] Like, to me, a towel… a towel is like ovaries. Like, whatever fucking towels you’re born with is the fucking towels you die with. [audience applauding, laughing] People will season a skillet. I season a fucking towel. [audience laughing] It’s like the same with, like, a pillow. Like, unless a pillow is 30 years old, I can’t get no sleep. [audience laughing] Unless a pillow is eggshell yellow… [audience laughing] …I’m not getting no Zs. To me, a pillow ages like a tree. Each ring. [laughs] Each ring, right? The darker the yellow ring, I’m like, “Oh, yeah, that was, like, ’04.” No, Britney was healthy back then. This was a good time. [audience laughing] It’s, like, so bad. Like, I’m coming up in the weird, like… [inhales sharply] Gay people having kids. Straight people… straight people not having kids. They’re getting dogs. Is it just me, or has the dog population bloomed? Right? There’s a lot of dogs. It’s… it’s a less safe place. There’s a lot of dogs. There’s a lot of dogs, right? People worried about AI. I’m still on dogs. [audience laughing] I think the dogs came up with the fucking AI as a red herring. to distract us. Acting dumb and shit. [audience laughing] I’m on to them. Right, because pit bulls are legal here. People have pit bulls? [audience member] Yeah! [scattered applause] Sick. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding. My only thing with the pit bull, really… No, I’ll move on, but my only thing with the pit bull was always, like, it’s always the first time. Right? You notice this? Like, it’s always… it’s always the first time. Right? The dog never attacked nobody before. They’re racking their brain. They can’t imagine what happened. It’s the first time, right? We left the dog with the niece. The cutest thing. You got to see them playing together. It’s the cutest thing. The niece, she’s sticking stickers into its face. It’s having the time of its life. They’re best friends. Sometimes we put the niece down for a nap. The dog is in the crib with her. It’s the cutest thing. Two peas in a pod. Come to find out a week later, the dog mauls the girl to fucking death. They don’t know. They don’t know what happened. They’re racking their brain, but “It’s never happened before.” “It’s the first time.” And you’re going, “I know.” Right, because we must have compassion for the pit bull people. Pit bull people, we must have compassion. We take for granted that we know up is up and down is down. but the pit bull people live in another world. We take for granted the sky is blue, up is up, down is down. They’re racking their brain. “It never happened before. It’s the first time.” And you as a non-pit bull person are going, “I know. That’s how everything ever has ever worked.” “Stuff doesn’t happen and then it happens.” “Now that you know this very simple pattern of life, you’re going to see it a lot more.” [audience laughing] “You will notice it.” And when something like this happens, when such a tragedy happens, who do we blame? Whose fault is it, right? Not the dog. A dog is always great. A dog is good. Pit bull, greatest dog on the planet. A friendlier breed, I do not know. A dog is great. When something like this happens, whose fault is it? Yes, the owner. Of course it’s the owner. It’s the person, right? It’s like guns. I’m pro-gun, obviously. [laughing] I think… I think… I think it’s pretty obvious tonight where this is going. I’m pro-gun, obviously. A gun on the floor. There it is. Look at that. That’s beautiful. It’s when people get near the guns, right? It’s like, A gun on the floor, what is that, brass? Look at that craftsmanship. That’s fantastic. Alec Baldwin near the gun, now I’m concerned. Never been about the gun. It’s just, it’s all getting worse. It’s all getting worse. And I don’t want to blame the gays here at this point in my set. Okay? But gay guys, they had that… Remember they had that “It Gets Better” campaign? You can understand why they didn’t come to the dykes. They didn’t come to lesbians for the positivity campaign, right? We would have been like, “It Gets Worse,” right? Like, they would… Like, they had Lance Bass telling kids in Arkansas to come out of the closet. A dyke would have been like, “Whoa, back!” Whoa, Nelly. “Actually, what you’re gonna wanna do is get some canned goods.” “You’re gonna wanna hunker down, get your provisions together, and you peak out every four or five years.” “You’re definitely gonna wanna get some canned goods.” “It gets much worse.” “In fact, this is actually good.” [laughs] “Like, this is actually…” They didn’t go to us for the… for the pride, you know, for the festivities. Because gay men, they’re a fun people. Did anybody go to Pride, people do Pride? [scattered applause, cheering] Proud of what? [audience laughing] No, I’m serious, guys. Proud of what? Gay and ashamed to the day I fucking die. [audience laughing] Get in the house. Shut the blinds. [audience laughing] Right? I understand why they went to gay guys. Like, gay guys are a fun people. Right? They’re a fun people. Like, as a lesbian, I think I’m funny. I’m not fun. Right? Like, we understand that. I’m funny. I’m not fun. Right? Like, I don’t play games. I’m not gonna be able to make your board game evening. [audience laughing] I’m in no mood to be spooked. [audience laughing] I’m not into any type of trickery. Whatever fucking pranks you’re all laughing at. Okay, I don’t even watch a horror movie. Okay, I find life thrilling enough. I watch… I watch a horror movie like Helen Keller, my eyes and ears closed. [laughs] [audience laughing] There’s nothing offensive about how she wa– That’s biology. That’s how Helen watches a movie. [audience laughing] If Helen were here tonight, she’d feel seen, so… [audience laughing] [exhales] Of course, she could… she could only feel seen. You know what I’m saying? It’s a… It’s a difficult concept to articulate. [audience laughing] The gay guys, they’re, like, a fun people. Like, you ever been to a gay dude’s house for dinner? Like, you ever been to a gay dude’s house? Right, there’s always, like, a signature cocktail. [audience laughing] There’s always like a theme. It’s always like the 1920s. [audience laughing] Which as a Jew, I’m like, “Could we not be?” [audience laughing] In the 1920s, all the Jews have to go enjoy the cocktail upstairs in the attic. [audience laughing] But you can’t deny what they’ve done with the place. What is this, West Elm? This is just beautiful. Love their rugs. You ever been to a lesbian’s house? [audience laughing] You ever been to a lesbian’s house? This is a serious affair. Take your shoes off! [audience laughing] Shut up and pay attention! [audience laughing] Today we’re talking about colonialism. [audience laughing] Pride to everyone. You can understand why the banks went a different route. They went a different direction on the festivities. Oh, but now everybody’s queer. It’s fantastic. It’s just wonderful. Just wonderful. You get to be queer, you get to be… Everybody gets to be queer. It’s fantastic, right? I met a girl like this, queer, sure, why not? Ah, here with a boyfriend, queer, who cares? [audience laughing] I somehow got to 30, never happened with a girl, but feel something… …inside queer. Like I’m not on the front fucking lines. [audience laughing] Knee-deep in pussy. [audience laughing] You’re gonna tell me you’re queer? Fuck outta here. [audience laughing, cheering] Do you know… [scoffs] Do you know what it’s like? Do you know what it’s like to go down on another girl? I can’t breathe. [audience laughing] Suffocating under the covers ’cause my girl’s cold. This fucker knows. Scissor me, bro. [audience laughing, cheering] You’re gonna tell me you’re queer? It’s always like, “Well, we kissed at camp.” [audience laughing] We French… We French kissed at camp. The summer kind for any elderly Jews here. I… [audience laughing] …apologize. [audience laughing] [laughs] We had a little French kiss at camp. Oh, you had a little tongue tie at camp? You ever have squirt in your face? I lost vision in an eye for a week. [audience laughing] You’re gonna tell me you’re queer? Fuck outta here. They’re like, “Well, we also… We pushed our beds together.” “We were so scared at night in the dark at camp.” “We pushed our beds together. So scary, the crickets.” [audience laughing] “And sometimes to help me fall asleep, sometimes she would tickle my arm.” “She tickled your arm? You ever have blood on your arm?” [audience applauding, laughing] Clotty fucking blood too. Blue and shit. Snotty-ass placenta fucking blood. [audience laughing] That’s not blood from a cut. That’s pussy blood. [audience laughing] It’s like… It’s like… It’s like… You’re in the headquarters, right? You have, like, an office job or a bullpen, maybe, like, a window. Right? And I’m out in the fucking field. Dodging squirt bombs and all kinds. [audience laughing] How many sets of sheets do you have? [audience laughing] [laughing] I got 19 sets of sheets. [audience applauding, laughing] It’s just, it’s too many sets of sheets for a person my age. I got 19. Full set, top, bottom, 19 sets of sheets. Straight men don’t have a single pair. [audience laughing] They just unfurl a roll of paper towel. [audience laughing] Overhead lighting, let’s get it done. [laughs] [exhales] Now somebody asked me if I’m trans. Just casual. I thought they were asking directions, so I was like, “Uh, I don’t know.” Like, this is just like, “How’s the weather now?” Just ask me if I’m trans. I’m already looking. I’m like, “I don’t even know where we…” The way they asked is just so casual. Am I trans? And I was like, “I don’t know. Something’s off.” [audience laughing] Your guess is as good as mine. Does this look normal to you? Does this look okay? You’ve seen women. You know ’em. You love ’em. Obviously something has gone awry. She had me thinking about it. I’m like, “Am I?” [laughs] And then I realized, “Oh my God, I’m not. Thank God.” I’m not in the mood for all of that. Where I grew up, I don’t need another thing. Thank you. [audience laughing] I realize I’m not, so the only way I can– Like, it was like, “Oh my God, I’m not.” The only way I realized I’m not trans ’cause I’m not… into crypto. It’s the only way I could know for sure. Right? ‘Cause I was like, “If I was trans, I mean, I’m a boy inside, I would understand crypto immediately.” “I don’t know fuck about crypto.” Which for those who are unfamiliar, uh, crypto is the male equivalent of astrology. It’s a… [audience laughing, cheering] …a lot to do with minerals and the earth and numerology. Um, but it’s a lot funner than astrology because you could also lose your house doing it. So that’s really fun. That’s really fun to lose everything. That’s just fantastic. Any, uh, any they, thems here? That fizzled out, huh? [winces] That fizzled out. Right? Last year, there would have been a whole bunch. [audience laughing] All right, have you noticed this? They’re walking that back now. Some of them, they’re walking it back. And I’ll say this, if you ever went by they, them, you should not be able to go back. No backsies, you plural bitch. No backsies. After all that. My friend… my friend came up to me. She said, “Oh yeah, I’m not really doing that anymore.” She’d been doing they, them for six years. “I’m not really doing that anymore.” I’m like, “Oh yes you are.” [audience laughing] “Oh yes you fucking are.” After all that? There was six of you. You made everyone, everyone change their shit for you. And you’re gonna walk it back now? There was six of you. You wrote me into it. Right, your life was good and you were rich, and you went to Wesleyan. You needed a problem, and you fucking took me with you. I used to just walk into a room, be able to be who the fuck I wanted to be. Now I walk in, they go, “What are your pronouns?” I’m like, “I don’t fucking know.” “Obviously something is off.” [audience laughing] So help me God, if a Brooklyn bitch with a boyfriend is walking that back now. [audience laughing] Not on my fucking watch. You made your bed. You will die… You will die a plural bitch, so help me God. Your tombstone will read, “They died here.” So help me God. You’re left with me, the last she, her on the motherfucking planet. Fellas, get a good look. [Robby laughs] Any, uh… [laughs] Any bisexuals here? [audience cheering] Okay. They wait every day to be asked that question. [audience laughing] Let me rephrase, let me rephrase. Any bisexual men here? [audience member] Woo! No. No. Bisexual men, I don’t think so. Bi– No means no. That’s a no. Bisexual men, no. [exhales] Even if you are a bisexual man, leave women alone. [audience applauding, laughing] They don’t want you. They don’t want you. Show of hands ladies, who here wants a bisexual man? Thank you. Thank you. The jury has spoken. Thank you. How are you gonna be something now where half of the thing that you need to be the thing doesn’t want you? Just a faggot like the rest of us. I’ll see you at Pride. Trying to get out of that shit. Get your sunscreen out. I’ll see you at Pride. You don’t think women have enough problems? [laughs] You don’t think women go through enough? Do you know the risk a woman takes dating a man? He could kill her. She could get raped. He could snap at any fucking moment. You think she needs your gay ass bringing home AIDS? I don’t think so. It’s gonna be a no for me, dog. It’s okay to laugh at that. It’s going to be a no for me, dog. It is sad that you guys laughed at that. I just said it, but you guys actually think it’s funny. That’s the problem. No, that is the problem. I do this to expose. I’m telling you. Anybody, uh, here have a dick? See… [laughs] No, you guys, I’m trying to be friendlier. See this– No, hold on, hold on. People are afraid to participate. Don’t be scared. You know, I’m approachable, right? Everybody knows this, I’m opposite Ellen. We all know this about me. No, everybody knows this. Nothing to be afraid of, okay? I’m opposite Ellen. You know how Ellen purports to be kind and nice? She’s dancing. But she’s actually a terror to work with. You guys have heard that. She’s a terror to work with, right? Well, I came out a little aggressive. I’m a little rough around the edges. But I’m actually a fucking delight to work with. [audience applauding, cheering] Okay. They’ll print that one day. One day it’ll come out I’m kind. You wait and see. You wait and see. That’s it. Anybody here have a… have a dick? [scattered cheering] You like your dick? Fantastic. You… you caress it? You take care of it? Right? He’s a responsible individual. I like that. Responsible man. Let me ask you this. [chuckles] If… [chuckles] If something were to happen to your dick, how would you feel? Speechless. Bereft. I understand. [audience laughing] So safe to say you love your dick? [audience member] I do. Yeah, safe to say… safe to say you love dick. All it takes is one. [audience applauding] All it takes is one. You’re fucking gay and it makes me sick. I don’t like no dick, mine or otherwise. Yet, I gotta be gay. No, you’re fucking gay. Happy Pride to you, faggot. [audience applauding] Everybody’s coming out tonight. Do we have any… any straight girls here? Any straight girls? So brave. Thank you for coming forward. No, you’re all perfect the way you are. Thank you. You know, I think we need the straight girl march next year. I believe this. Last marginalized people on the planet, right You better believe that’s a march I go to. [laughs] [audience laughing] Call me a fucking ally at this shit. [audience laughing] A dyke march? I’m not going to that. Ew, this reeks. Reeks, pee-ew. No, straight girls it’s hard. Like, any… any single straight girls here? Any losers? No, it happens. It happens. No, it happens. It happens. It happens. ‘Cause the problem is straight girls, you know, they have to, last time I checked, they’re dating men. Right? Of course, I’ve been wrong about this before. My wife was the Bachelorette, and she had 25 boyfriends three years ago. [laughs] I have been wrong about that. For the most part, straight girls, they’re dating men. And that’s hard because men aren’t what they used to be. Right? We now have 37-year-old men. We now have 37-year-old men saying, “That’s so sick. That’s fire.” That’s where we’re at as a society. That’s where we’re at. You say, “That’s sick. That’s fire.” You make me fucking sick. [audience laughing] My friend Carmen, he called me. He’s like, “Hey Rob, why didn’t you come to my birthday party?” I was like, “Huh?” He’s like, “Yeah, I sent you the Partiful.” [audience laughing] I said, ‘Carm, how old are you turning?” And he said, “39.” I said, “39?!” No, I don’t go to a 39-year-old grown man’s birthday party. What, are you fucking gay? [audience laughing] Birthday parties are for women and children. What are we doing? What am I getting there and we’re playing “Duck, duck, goose”? What the fuck is going on? But it’s hard for women. It’s hard for everyone to date. And I realize that part of the problem is we’ve overcomplicated everything. Overcomplicated, right? We have so many apps and so many… And I’m like, “Let’s just bring it back to basics.” I came up with an equation, just a simple– I’m still working out the math, but I came up with a simple theory. You know, listen, it doesn’t matter who you’re dating, what your sexuality is, it’s for everyone. I’m for the people. You understand this. I look out for everyone. Simple equation. Forget the apps, forget everything. All you need to– Okay. All you need– Let me– Oh yeah. Per every relationship. Okay, let’s start there. Right. Per… This is all you need. Per every relationship, all you need is one hot… [scattered laughter] …one smart. How you divvy it up, I don’t give a fuck. How you divvy it up, I don’t give a fuck. We’re used to seeing a classic example of that in this country, right? Typically, we see, like, an older, smart dude with a young, hot thing. That’s a beautiful sight. That is evergreen. That is an American classic. That is here to stay. It’s like slipping into a pair of Calvins. They just fit. It’s a beautiful sight. But you ever see… You ever see the opposite? You ever see, like, a pretty boy? Like an Abercrombie type with, like, a bookish, glasses-wearing type of girl? That shit can work too. A Walk to Remember, was that a fucking movie? Was that a fucking movie? One hot, one smart. How you divvy it up, I don’t give a fuck. People think in my own relationship, they think Gabby is 100% the hot circle. Right? But… but, I happen to be a bit of a cutie. It is what it is. So I’m giving 10%. Okay? I… I’m earning my keep. I’m contributing. She’s still got 90. Calm down. People get mad. She’s still got 90, but I’m earning my keep. And then for some reason, people assume that I’m 100% the smart circle. They forget Gabby was an ICU nurse for eight and a half fucking years. She’s practically a doctor in this country. We split the smart circle 50-50. One hot, one smart. How you divvy it, I don’t give a fuck. Figure out your ratios, what you have, and what you fucking need. [audience laughing] You guys are doing the ratios, so your ratios are off. You ever see two hots together? Hollywood, it’s a fucking disaster. [audience laughing] Right? It doesn’t matter how many times J-Lo and Ben fucking try, and they’re gearing up to go again, it’ll never happen. You’re missing an entire circle. You ever see two smarts together? That’s two uggos. That’s a hazard on the road. Guys, come on. Be responsible. You want to be the traffic jam I was referring to? Come on. Come on. Use the math response. No, the truth is Gab is the most beautiful woman inside and out. We all agree. [audience applauding, cheering] But… [laughs] But… [chuckles] She did something rather disgusting. It happens. It happens. It happens. Right? I don’t even know really where to… I’ll just say what happened. Start there, right? You guys have been wonderful to me. Let me just tell… Okay. [chuckles] I’m stalling. Okay. [clicks tongue] Okay, I caught her removing– Okay, yeah. I– Just say what happened, Rob. Okay, I caught her removing the bathroom trash can from the bathroom. Okay, so we already– It’s already in the title there, right? The bath– So I caught her removing the bathroom trash can from the bathroom. Right? That’s where it lives. That’s its habitat. Right? You can’t just throw that into the wild of the rest of the house. It’s not domesticated. Right? So I said, “What’s going on?” And she said so casual, just in her cute Gab, just… [squeals] Just so cute. She was just so cute. She was like, “Oh, I’m just going to…” I can barely even say it. She just said, like, so casually. She was just like, “Oh, I’m just going to clip my toenails.” [clicks tongue] Which one of you sick animals here tonight clips your toenails on your living room couch? [audience laughing] That’s a sick bitch right there. That is a sick bitch right there. Always the hottest ones are sickest. [audience laughing] I guarantee when they paint over your apartment, when they paint over your place, when you move, and they paint over your place, they’ll have to paint over anywhere between five to seven crescents… [audience laughing] …of your fucking toenail that have lodged themselves so deep into your living room, a vacuum could never go. [audience laughing] And she goes, “It’s okay. I catch ’em all.” [audience laughing] She goes, “It’s okay. I catch ’em all in here.” [scattered laughter] Huh? Everybody knows a toenail goes wherever the fuck a toenail wants to go. We have no jurisdiction as mere laymen as to the trajectory of a fucking toenail. That’s why like a normal person, you get in the bathroom, you lock the door. You cut your shit and pray you don’t go blind. Chas v’shalom. God forbid I should get thirsty while she’s doing this shit. And I gotta walk through the living room to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, but to be hit in the eye… …by one of her rogue nails. Between the squirt and that, I’m lucky to be alive. Thank God I wear glasses. [exhales] And look, it’s okay. Maybe she didn’t learn. Look. No, maybe she didn’t learn. You know, school I don’t think is a place. I never learned anything in school about how to lead a decent life. You know, I learned nothing about financial or tax planning, any domesticity, how to keep a home, so now we gotta figure shit out. Right? And I do believe though, there’s a lesson in everything, big or small. Lesson in everything, big or small. Even the bathroom trash can. Maybe she didn’t know, right? There’s only one way to do the bathroom trash can, for instance. Okay, there’s only one way to do the bathroom trash can. That is… open concept. Waste paper basket. Don’t overthink it. Right? But some of you thought you’d get fancy going through the Target, splurge $24.99 USD on the kick lid. And you regret the day you were ever fucking born. Because the kick lid in a small– The kick lid is better suited for the larger kitchen size where you have that type of clearance. [exhales sharply] Is that nice? In the small… In the cramped bathroom and a small size with the lid and the spine and the heaviness and the pedal, you’re asking too much of its little body. You’re asking too much of its little body. All right, how the physics work? How are you even going to kick that from your toilet, huh? Gotta throw out your fucking hip? Right? Now you’re gonna kick this shit too hard. You broke this shit. Haven’t had it ten days. You broke this shit. And you’re left doing what? The… The lift and tuck. The worst feeling a person can ever know. And he knows it well. He knows it well. Every time you lift and tuck into the ether of whatever the fuck you have in your trash can, you wanna fucking die. And still you don’t take your trash out. [audience laughing] But some of you don’t have the commitment it takes for a bathroom trash can. Some of you don’t have the commitment for a bathroom trash can to empty it regularly. Some of you will get home after tonight’s show and you’ll wipe your ass and dangle it onto a mountain you fucking created. Trying to dangle it onto a slippery bottle of Pantene Pro-V, which is too fucking big to throw out there to begin with. And still you don’t take your trash out ’cause you wanna fucking die. Some of you don’t have the commitment it takes to maintain a bathroom trash can, take it out regularly. Yet you ask me why the fuck you’re still single? If you can’t commit to a bathroom trash can, how you gonna commit to a bitch, faggot? [audience laughing] You can’t even take the trash out for your girl, yet you want to ask me how I got the final fucking rose. Wake up. [audience applauding, cheering] Wake up. So it’s like, it is okay that your men are weak. For me, how I grew up. No, it’s okay that your men are weak and your women are disgusting. Because I grew up in such a house. I grew up in such a house. I grew up without a father, and my mother is the most disgusting woman in America. I wish it wasn’t so. I wish it wasn’t so. I had to find this out recently. It’s terrible. My little sister got married in Vancouver. Mazel Tov, mazel Tov. And we just went out there, we went out there for the wedding. And a few days before the wedding, we did a cute, like, a girls dinner. Right? Like just me, we went out a few days before, just me, my four sisters, and my mother, no guys allowed, right? I also have five brothers. Yeah, my mother has an enormous vagina as you can imagine. That’s where I get mine from. I’m very blessed. [audience laughing, cheering] I’m very blessed. Thank you, sir, I do just fine. I appreciate that. And we get to this chain restaurant. The dinner is off to a terrible start. Okay, my little sister, she gets back from the bathroom. She’s pissed off. There was piss all over the seat. She had to squat. Disgusting. I was like, “Well I don’t have the leg muscles to squat.” “So what I do when there’s piss all over the seat, the public bathroom, is I gotta wipe it down. I work there now. [audience laughing] Then I cover it, like, two, three times due to my faith. And then I relieve myself. And it kind of ends up turning into, like, a fun little game, like, going around the table with me and my sisters. Like, “Hey, what do you do when there’s piss all over the seat?” “Do you squat like her, or do you wipe it down like me?” And we get to my mother, and she’d rather not share. [audience groans] [audience laughing] She’s shy about this shit. And I’m like, “Come on, Ma, we’re having girl talk.” I check her. [audience laughing] “Come on, Ma, this is the share circle.” “Ma, what do you do when there’s piss all over the seat?” “Do you squat like her, or do you wipe it down like me?” And she goes, “Oh, okay.” “I guess I sort of just lift the seat and sit there.” [audience exclaims, laughs] She sits on the bowl. [audience laughing] [coughs] She raw dogs the bowl. You ever accidentally sit on the bowl? You’re like, “I have AIDS.” It’s like– [audience laughing] Even if that’s what this bitch does, she just heard the two only acceptable options. You’d think she’d pick one and use it going forward. She’s like, “No, I am the most disgusting woman in America.” “And what I left out was I lick it first just to make sure it’s clean.” I am Robby Hoffman. [audience applauding, cheering] My… Thank you so… [cheering continues] …so much, LA. I knew I was saving something special for you. Thank you. I’m Robby Hoffman. Follow me on everything. My God.

    "transcript":"Robby Hoffman: Wake Upis the second hour-long stand-up comedy special from American-Canadian comedianRobby Hoffman.The special was filmed at The Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever in Los Angeles and was directed by comedian John Mulaney. Release Date:December 14, 2025 (Netflix) Robby Hoffman: Wake Upis a deliberately confrontational stand-up special that weaponizes shock, exaggeration, and relentless logic flips to interrogate contemporary identity politics. Hoffman moves through sex, gender, queerness, abortion, dating, parenting, class, and cultural hypocrisy with a persona that blends aggression and self-exposure. Jokes escalate through taboo to expose what she sees as evasions, performative morality, and intellectual laziness across straight and queer cultures alike. Beneath the provocation runs a throughline about responsibility, adulthood, and commitment, crystallized in domestic absurdities and relationship math. The title functions as a thesis: comedy as an alarm, not comfort. [“Dreams” by The Cranberries playing] [emcee] Once in a while, you get to see a legend at the absolute top of their game. Put your hands together for the one, the only, Robby Hoffman. ♪ Is changing every day ♪ ♪ In every possible way ♪ How’s it going, fa*gots? Are we doing this shit? Are we doing this shit? [audience applauding, cheering] Everyone’s a little gay, huh? Some obviously more than others. The fellas are for sure a little gay. Especially, right? Especially. Those are your skinny jeans? Especially the fellas. No, every dude’s got a little gay in them. But they’re not allowed to be a little gay like we’re allowed to be gay. And that’s fair because we’ve been on good behavior. Fellas, you give us a 100 years warfree, we’ll talk fucking privileges. All right. The dudes aren’t allowed to be a little gay. All right. But, like, are you guys a couple? Right, like, if he told you, ma’am, that he was a little gay, you’d be like, what are you, fucking gay? We don’t want to know. Fellas, you have a gay thought, you keep that shit to yourself. You keep that shit to yourself. They’re not allowed to be a little gay, but still, they gotta get the little gay out somehow. It’s gonna seep the fuck out. But they can only get the gay out in the ways that are appropriate. The ways that are socially acceptable. Right? That’s why they play football. [laughs] [audience laughing] Even gayer, they watch it. There’s no other way to explain. A dude will wear a shirt with another man’s name on it. I’m not making this up, but dude will Excuse me, he’ll go to the store, he’ll purchase a shirt. He’ll pay extra to have another man’s name embroidered onto the shirt. [audience applauding, laughing] If another planet landed here, they’d be like, “Doesn’t that sound too obviously gay?” But no, that’s what the fellas here are doing. And they’re not doing this in secret. They’re not doing this in the dead of the night in back alleys. They’re doing this broad daylight, Sunday at noon. The fellas in this country wake up Sunday at noon with a pep in their step. Throw on a shirt with another man’s name on it. Run down the stairs hard as a rock, ready to watch this shit. [audience applauding, cheering] Every dude’s got a little gay in ’em. Just like every dude’s got a little pedophilia in them. That took a fucking turn, didn’t it? That took a motherfucking turn. Ah, you like ’em young? Show of hands, who here… who here likes a tight puss? What, you like a loose puss? Exactly. The problem with the fellas is they’re never upfront about who they are. We always have to catch them. That’s why we have the issues. We have to catch them. They never just tell us. They never just tell us, like, “You know, occasionally I suck a dick, and…” [laughs] [audience laughing] “Every so often I like a teenager.” Thank you for being honest.” Let’s go from there.” We have to catch them. They’re not mad about who the fuck they are. Right? Like, at least I’m man enough to say, “You got me. I’m gay.” You see what’s going on with the outfit. I’m not pulling a fast one on anyone, right? So who’s gonna be man enough tonight? Who is going to be man enough tonight for Netflix and the world to admit to me they like kids? Thank you, sir in the baseball cap. I appreciate that. Thank you. Give it up for the pedophile in the eighth row. I appreciate that. One pedophile down, two to go. It being LA, could be six. I don’t want to alarm. [audience laughing] I don’t want to alarm. By the way, you only got a little bit pedophile. It’s like you’re not95% greatest guy in the world. 95% could be the greatest guy in the world. 5% jail. That is the makeup of any man. That is the makeup of a man, right? 95% is a great partner, is a great father. He’s a great contributor. He5% “I didn’t know how young she was.” My favorite is like, “Well, she was at the club.” She was at the venue. She was at a location. “Well, the club let her…” “What am I to do as a man? They let the nine-year-old in.” “What am I to do as a man?” I’m going to go, “You know what? He’s got a point.” No, pedophiles get a bad rap. [laughs] Oh, I’m not saying I feel bad for them. I’m not saying I feel bad for them, okay, pedophiles. Pedophiles get a bad rap. Nobody has nothing good to say about them. I mean, I’m sure some of them are fine people. I don’t know the community. Nobody has, you know, nothing good to say about pedophiles. I understand that. I agree with you. Even for the sake of the joke, I was trying to think, like, “What’s even a good thing you could call a pedophile?” Just as a writing exercise, what’s even.. What, like a priest? I don’t know. I’m just… [chuckles] [audience applauding, laughing] I’m… I’m just spitballing. I’m just spitballing here, right? What, like a president? I don’t know, right? I was… I don’t know. Ultimately, nobody has nothing good to say about pedophiles, and I agree. …what about all these kids? Into the pedophiles, huh? What about all these sicko kids into these fucking grownups. They’re getting away scotfree? I had some kid jump up on me last week. I said, “Get the fuck off of me!” I don’t swing that way. All I’m saying is, there’s two sides to every… No, I… [audience applauding] But it’s tough to hear about all this stuff all the time, you know? And, you know, like, I’ve noticed that nobody’s ever tried to sex-traffic me, and I’m trying not to take it so personal. I’m trying not to take it, but just the sheer level that you hear of this happening, just the sheer volume of this operation. What, nobody wants me on an island? This does nothing for the billionaires? I got an enlarged clitoris. Are you getting this in? Are you getting this in? And the hot girls, they get mad. Uncross your arms. Calm down. Calm, okay? Okay, the hot girls, they get mad at me, okay? Okay, they get mad at me. Calm down. I’m not… I’m not saying I’m your hottest girl on this island. Okay? I’m not saying I’m your Atier. I don’t even think I’m your Blevel girl on this island. I’m talking, those girls, they’re on break. Right? They’re on break. Right? That’s when you bring this dyke out for a tug. Is that what the fella’s like, or what? Do I know? Do I know? Right, a little cinch at the end. I call that the zip tie. That’s a good move. No, I give a hand job like a Bop It. Squeeze it, pull it, bop it. The fellas love that. I’m telling you right now. Don’t I know it? The fellas love… If there’s one thing I know about the fellas, they love spontaneity. The Bop It is for you. Any couples together a long time? You gotta keep it spicy. The Bop It is for you. Right? You get home from the show tonight, you… you dust off the old handy, he’ll never know what hit him. Right? You’re going in on him, you’re going in on him, he’s about to come, he’s about to come. “No, you don’t.” Bop it! [audience applauding] I’m telling you, ladies, this is the move. I’m here to help. This is the move. I… I see Mormons sometimes, right? I go… Right, Mormons, it’s good for them too, right? They can’t do nothing. Right? You hit them with the bop it, “Gonna come, gonna come.” “No, you don’t. The fuck back in there.” “Jesus didn’t see shit.” [audience applauding, cheering] For the closeted gay… Guys, how are you gonna be gay if you didn’t come? But for me, it’s like any issue you pluck, it’s the worst thing. So it doesn’t matter, like, you know, like sex traffic, I never even heard about it till two years. You know, I didn’t even know that was a kind of traffic. Like, to me, I’m still stuck on traffic traffic, you know what I mean? I’m still like, that’s a major problem, like, right? Like, I don’t… I can’t be splitting my attention right now. We haven’t handled the first type of traffic. I’m at… I’m at a point, and that’s what I did in LA, I’m at a point, and we know this in LA, I’m at a point, and I’m talking standstill, when I’m in gridlock traffic like only we know. Right, when I’m in gridlock traffic, I’m gonna need a pileup at the end of that. [audience laughing, applauding] [woman] Yeah! That’s where I’m at emotionally speaking. Right, like, if you’re gonna add 27 minutes. You’re gonna add 27 minutes to my route, I better see a dead child flung from the windshield Ideally, the ambulance has already arrived at the scene. You better give me someone to look at when I fucking pull through. This is Hollywood, baby. If there is a God, and if there is a God… [laughs] just when I’m… just when I’m pulling through, just as I’m getting through the bottleneck, the child is pronounced dead at the scene. The child’s pronounced This is… Twenty-eight minutes? Dead twins. The price goes up, bitch. This is America. Nothing is free. I want to get their paint, and say, I want them doing “Clear.” Right, they never do “Clear” anymore. What happened to fucking “Clear”? “Clear, we don’t know, clear.” Bring fucking “Clear” back. Now we just let people die. Not even clearing people anymore. It’s just, it’s all like, it’s all like so bad, like all the issues. Like, okay, is this like a, is this like a prochoice type crowd? [audience applauding, cheering] [laughs] I don’t know. We know it ain’t right. Dykes, we sat out on this shit, didn’t we? We said, “Straights, this one’s on you.” “If you’re making kids, you’re breeding, come on.” “Can’t you figure out your own shit once in a while?” We’re a small community. We’re a small community because every time I like dip into the straight world, I’m like, “They’re still on that?!” Like, we’ve had progress. I got married. They’re still on this? Fuck, I guess they do need help. Like, time to get a dyke on the case. Feefifofum, here I fucking come. Because I was like feeling bad. I was like, “Well, Rob, just ’cause something doesn’t affect you, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know about it.” Right, like, do you guys agree it’s important to be informed about the issues? Right? Like, it’s important to be informed about the issues, right? So I thought, “All right, let me look this shit up.” Let’s see what these straights are even crying about. I decided to get home, look this shit up, ask Jeeves, what is… We can discuss this tonight. You know, I’m a firm believer comedy should keep it light. People know this about me. Okay, let’s just keep it light, right? Let’s just discuss this tonight. Let’s not ruffle any feathers, okay? We can discuss it tonight. It’s… killing a baby. [chuckles] So perfect, it’s killing a baby, and that’s okay. Some people get stuck on that already. They don’t know if it’s a baby or not, and I’m not an economist, so I don’t know. You know, I’ve been wrong before. Could be a cantaloupe. I feel like it’s gonna be a baby. And we’re killing that baby, and that’s okay. In fact, I give a mother till ten… What I realized is the straights, this is why they can’t figure nothing out. They’re thinking about They don’t know how to think about their issues. They’re going about it wrong, right? They’re focused on the wrong things. They get stuck in the weeds. Right? They’re debating stupid shit like “At 16 weeks, is it developed?” “At 20 weeks, is it developed?” “Is a five-year-old developed?” No, that’s why I give till ten, just in case. A bitch can clock her nine-year-old in the head. Because did you see how he was talking to her? Exactly, turn around, mind your business, there’s an abortion happening… People can be so rude. Can’t you give the woman some privacy? It’s a difficult decision to abort a nine-year-old. My God. Have some compassion. No, the straights, they can’t solve nothing because they don’t know how to think about their issues. They don’t know how to go about their issues, right? They’re debating things like, “Four months, late-term abortion, nine months…” I’m thinking the future. We raise the age of abortion till ten. We got a lot of well-fucking-behaved kids on our hands that way. [audience applauding] A lot of made beds in the morning. A lot of help bringing the groceries into the car. Let’s make kids worth saving. How’s that for an idea? Late-late-stage abortion. Who’s with me? [laughs] [audience applauding, cheering] So weird. Like, everything’s kind of, like, flipped now. Like… [inhales, exhales] Straight people fighting for the right not to have a baby, and… [sighs] I hate gay people with kids. I don’t know. [laughs] Gay people having kids? That was the whole point. How do you ruin being gay? That was the one thing we got. That was the one silver lining. We signed that deal, right? In the 80s, our forefathers, they went out. They were like, “Be gay, get fucked, get AIDS. No kids.” “We signed that deal.” People died for these rights. It’s not just that gay people are having kids. It’s that they want their own biological kids. Right? I know fags and dykes getting together and mixing their shit up. “God doesn’t like us. We’re gonna be God.” Right? Like… like, we forget. Like, we had an understanding with society. We forget we had an understanding with society. Right? At some point, society let us be gay. Fantastic. Thank you so much. At some point, society was like, “You get to be gay, but… but you got to adopt all these loose fucking kids.” [laughs] That was the pitch. That was the whole idea. It was like making lemonade out of lemons. It was natural. It was organic. It’s like, “We can’t have kids. They can’t have parents.” [audience applauding, laughing] Right? Like, obviously, people would still think it’s weird we’re gay. Right? So people would still be like, “It’s kinda weird that they’re gay, but at least they’re cleaning up all these fucking loosies.” Who just wants loose kids running around? You ever in a parking lot, somebody’s kid, I’m like, “Whose fucking kid is this?” Because as a kid, I remember being… sad. I was like… [exhales] “What if I grow up and I’m still gay?” It wasn’t looking good. [laughs] [audience laughing] In the mirror in my brother Menachem’s pants, “But they look so sick though.” “Oh yeah, I might have to take these. This shit’s mine now.” I remember being a kid, and I was sad. I was like, “What if you grow up and you’re still gay?” And you want a family, you want kids. I was too young to decide. I came from such a large family. I was like, “What if you want a family, you want kids?” And then I remember being, like, relieved. I was like, “Oh yeah.” “I actually heard about this.” “I actually think I just heard about this.” If you grow up and you’re gay, you want a family, you want kids, at some point, they’ll throw you, like, a 9yearold. “This is Tony. Look at that.” “Wow, isn’t that fantastic?” “He’s got all his shots. He’s moving ready. I love that.” Turnkey Tony, that’s just terrific. “What a cutie, what a cutie.” [audience applauding, laughing] And if, like, a few years later, your wife wanted another kid or whatever, they give you like a 15yearold. Of course, he’s got severe anger management issues, as you can imagine. Twice the size of me. I could die at any moment. But this is Tony and Miguel. Right? That’s what the gay American family was supposed to be. That’s what the gay American family was supposed to look like. [audience laughing, cheering] Never mind I got the Menendez brothers. [laughing] I could die at any… You know I’m going to raise men out of these boys. [laughs] I got Rogan playing all day. Right? And the fags, the fags, they’re going to adopt all the loose little girls. Right? All the girls go to the gay dads. Right? These girls are fucking decked. You’ve never seen hotter girls… …in your life, right? Girls’ prom comes around, gay daddy’s making the dress him-fucking-self. Other gay daddy’s at the florist. “The corsage better match perfect.” You’ve never seen hotter girls than the girls who walk out of the house with the two gay dads. Dykes, we were gonna raise men out of these boys. And the fags, they’re gonna raise women out of these girls. So while you’re all raising your they, thems, whatever the fuck you’ve done with your own kids, [scattered applause, cheering] we’re gonna raise men and women once again. [audience applauding, cheering] Don’t… don’t even worry about it. These gays will straighten this whole mess out. My parents were straight. They let me leave the house looking like this. Terrible with these straight parents making gays and theys and queers. You know, it’s okay. I grew up really bad. I grew up really bad. I’m starting to realize the extent of how, you know, bad I grew up in many ways. Right? Like, you ever realize you grow up poor ’cause you like a hard towel? This is the shit now, right? Like, I’m starting to be friends with richer people now. I went to somebody’s house. They have a pool. And they gave me a towel. First of all, I brought my own towel. I was like… [chuckles] [audience laughing] …embarrassed. I was like, “Okay, they got the towels.” It’s poor to bring your own towel. Who Nobody else but me showed up with a fucking towel. And she gives me the towel, and it’s like fluffy. Right? And I tried to use the towel, and I was like, “I feel like I’m still wet.” Like… Am I… Am I supposed to dry the towel? Is the towel drying me? Like, what’s the process on the fluffy towel? And she goes, “Oh, we just got new towels.” I was like, “New towels?” Like, to me, new and towel. Like, to me, seeing “new” and “towel” together, like, I can’t even… Like, they’re selling these? [chuckles] To me, a towel is, like, built with the house, like… Like, to me, a towel… a towel is like ovaries. Like, whatever fucking towels you’re born with is the fucking towels you die with. [audience applauding, laughing] People will season a skillet. I season a fucking towel. It’s like the same with, like, a pillow. Like, unless a pillow is 30 years old, I can’t get no sleep. [chuckles] [audience laughing] Unless a pillow is eggshell yellow… …I’m not getting no Zs. To me, a pillow ages like a tree. [laughs] Each ring, right? The darker the yellow ring, I’m like, “Oh, yeah, that was, like, ’04.” No, Britney was healthy back then. This was a good time. Like, I’m coming up in the weird, like… [inhales sharply] Gay people having kids. Straight people… straight people not having kids. They’re getting dogs. Is it just me, or has the dog population bloomed? Right? There’s a lot of dogs. It’s… it’s a less safe place. There’s a lot of dogs. There’s a lot of dogs, right? People worried about AI. I think the dogs came up with the fucking AI as a red herring. Acting dumb and shit. Right, because pit bulls are legal here. People have pit bulls? [audience member] Yeah! [scattered applause] Sick. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding. My only thing with the pit bull, really… No, I’ll move on, but my only thing with the pit bull was always, like, it’s always the first time. Right? You notice this? Like, it’s always… it’s always the first time. Right? The dog never attacked nobody before. They’re racking their brain. They can’t imagine what happened. It’s the first time, right? We left the dog with the niece. You got to see them playing together. It’s the cutest thing. The niece, she’s sticking stickers into its face. It’s having the time of its life. They’re best friends. Sometimes we put the niece down for a nap. The dog is in the crib with her. It’s the cutest thing. Come to find out a week later, the dog mauls the girl to fucking death. They don’t know what happened. They’re racking their brain, but “It’s never happened before.” “It’s the first time.” And you’re going, “I know.” Right, because we must have compassion for the pit bull people. Pit bull people, we must have compassion. We take for granted that we know up is up and down is down. but the pit bull people live in another world. We take for granted the sky is blue, up is up, down is down. They’re racking their brain. “It never happened before. It’s the first time.” And you as a non-pit bull person are going, “I know. That’s how everything ever has ever worked.” “Stuff doesn’t happen and then it happens.” “Now that you know this very simple pattern of life, you’re going to see it a lot more.” “You will notice it.” And when something like this happens, when such a tragedy happens, who do we blame? Whose fault is it, right? A dog is always great. Pit bull, greatest dog on the planet. A friendlier breed, I do not know. When something like this happens, whose fault is it? Of course it’s the owner. It’s the person, right? I’m progun, obviously. [laughing] I think… I think… I think it’s pretty obvious tonight where this is going. I’m progun, obviously. A gun on the floor. There it is. Look at that. That’s beautiful. It’s when people get near the guns, right? It’s like, A gun on the floor, what is that, brass? Look at that craftsmanship. Alec Baldwin near the gun, now I’m concerned. Never been about the gun. It’s just, it’s all getting worse. It’s all getting worse. And I don’t want to blame the gays here at this point in my set. But gay guys, they had that… Remember they had that “It Gets Better” campaign? You can understand why they didn’t come to the dykes. They didn’t come to lesbians for the positivity campaign, right? We would have been like, “It Gets Worse,” right? Like, they would… Like, they had Lance Bass telling kids in Arkansas to come out of the closet. A dyke would have been like, “Whoa, back!” “Actually, what you’re gonna wanna do is get some canned goods.” “You’re gonna wanna hunker down, get your provisions together, and you peak out every four or five years.” “You’re definitely gonna wanna get some canned goods.” “It gets much worse.” “In fact, this is actually good.” [laughs] “Like, this is actually…” They didn’t go to us for the… for the pride, you know, for the festivities. Because gay men, they’re a fun people. Did anybody go to Pride, people do Pride? [exclaims] [scattered applause, cheering] Proud of what? No, I’m serious, guys. Proud of what? Gay and ashamed to the day I fucking die. Get in the house. Shut the blinds. Right? I understand why they went to gay guys. Like, gay guys are a fun people. Right? They’re a fun people. Like, as a lesbian, I think I’m funny. I’m not fun. Right? Like, we understand that. I’m funny. I’m not fun. Right? Like, I don’t play games. I’m not gonna be able to make your board game evening. I’m in no mood to be spooked. I’m not into any type of trickery. Whatever fucking pranks you’re all laughing at. Okay, I don’t even watch a horror movie. Okay, I find life thrilling enough. I watch… I watch a horror movie like Helen Keller, my eyes and ears closed. [laughs] There’s nothing offensive about how she wa… That’s biology. That’s how Helen watches a movie. If Helen were here tonight, she’d feel seen, so… [laughs] [audience laughing] [exhales] Of course, she could… she could only feel seen. You know what I’m saying? It’s a… It’s a difficult concept to articulate. The gay guys, they’re, like, a fun people. Like, you ever been to a gay dude’s house for dinner? Like, you ever been to a gay dude’s house? Right, there’s always, like, a signature cocktail. There’s always like a theme. It’s always like the 1920s. Which as a Jew, I’m like, “Could we not be?” [laughs] [audience laughing] In the 1920s, all the Jews have to go enjoy the cocktail upstairs in the attic. [audience laughing] But you can’t deny what they’ve done with the place. What is this, West Elm? This is just beautiful. You ever been to a lesbian’s house? You ever been to a lesbian’s house? This is a serious affair. Shut up and pay attention! Today we’re talking about colonialism. You can understand why the banks went a different route. They went a different direction on the festivities. Oh, but now everybody’s queer. It’s fantastic. It’s just wonderful. You get to be queer, you get to be… Everybody gets to be queer. It’s fantastic, right? I met a girl like this, queer, sure, why not? Ah, here with a boyfriend, queer, who cares? I somehow got to 30, never happened with a girl, but feel something… Like I’m not on the front fucking lines. You’re gonna tell me you’re queer? [audience laughing, cheering] Do you know… [scoffs] Do you know what it’s like? Do you know what it’s like to go down on another girl? Suffocating under the covers ’cause my girl’s cold. [audience laughing, cheering] You’re gonna tell me you’re queer? It’s always like, “Well, we kissed at camp.” We French… We French kissed at camp. The summer kind for any elderly Jews here. I… We had a little French kiss at camp. Oh, you had a little tongue tie at camp? You ever have squirt in your face? I lost vision in an eye for a week. You’re gonna tell me you’re queer? They’re like, “Well, we also… We pushed our beds together.” “We were so scared at night in the dark at camp.” “We pushed our beds together. So scary, the crickets.” “And sometimes to help me fall asleep, sometimes she would tickle my arm.” “She tickled your arm? You ever have blood on your arm?” [audience applauding, laughing] Clotty fucking blood too. Snotty-ass placenta fucking blood. That’s not blood from a cut. It’s like… It’s like… You’re in the headquarters, right? You have, like, an office job or a bullpen, maybe, like, a window. Right? And I’m out in the fucking field. Dodging squirt bombs and all kinds. How many sets of sheets do you have? [laughing] I got 19 sets of sheets. [audience applauding, laughing] It’s just, it’s too many sets of sheets for a person my age. I got 19. Full set, top, bottom, 19 sets of sheets. Straight men don’t have a single pair. They just unfurl a roll of paper towel. Overhead lighting, let’s get it done. Now somebody asked me if I’m trans. I thought they were asking directions, so I was like, “Uh, I don’t know.” Like, this is just like, “How’s the weather now?” Just ask me if I’m trans. I’m already looking. I’m like, “I don’t even know where we…” The way they asked is just so casual. And I was like, “I don’t know. Something’s off.” Your guess is as good as mine. Does this look normal to you? You know ’em. You love ’em. Obviously something has gone awry. She had me thinking about it. I’m like, “Am I?” [laughs] And then I realized, “Oh my God, I’m not. Thank God.” I’m not in the mood for all of that. Where I grew up, I don’t need another thing. I realize I’m not, so the only way I can… Like, it was like, “Oh my God, I’m not.” The only way I realized I’m not trans ’cause I’m not… into crypto. It’s the only way I could know for sure. Right? ‘Cause I was like, “If I was trans, I mean, I’m a boy inside, I would understand crypto immediately.” “I don’t know fuck about crypto.” Which for those who are unfamiliar, uh, crypto is the male equivalent of astrology. [audience laughing, cheering] …a lot to do with minerals and the earth and numerology. Um, but it’s a lot funner than astrology because you could also lose your house doing it. So that’s really fun. That’s really fun to lose everything. That’s just fantastic. Any, uh, any they, thems here? That fizzled out, huh? [winces] That fizzled out. Right? Last year, there would have been a whole bunch. All right, have you noticed this? They’re walking that back now. Some of them, they’re walking it back. And I’ll say this, if you ever went by they, them, you should not be able to go back. No backsies, you plural bitch. My friend… my friend came up to me. She said, “Oh yeah, I’m not really doing that anymore.” She’d been doing they, them for six years. “I’m not really doing that anymore.” I’m like, “Oh yes you are.” “Oh yes you fucking are.” There was six of you. You made everyone, everyone change their shit for you. And you’re gonna walk it back now? There was six of you. You wrote me into it. Right, your life was good and you were rich, and you went to Wesleyan. You needed a problem, and you fucking took me with you. I used to just walk into a room, be able to be who the fuck I wanted to be. Now I walk in, they go, “What are your pronouns?” I’m like, “I don’t fucking know.” “Obviously something is off.” So help me God, if a Brooklyn bitch with a boyfriend is walking that back now. Not on my fucking watch. You will die… You will die a plural bitch, so help me God. Your tombstone will read, “They died here.” You’re left with me, the last she, her on the motherfucking planet. Fellas, get a good look. Any, uh… [laughs] Any bisexuals here? They wait every day to be asked that question. Let me rephrase, let me rephrase. Any bisexual men here? [audience member] Woo! Bisexual men, I don’t think so. No means no. That’s a no. Even if you are a bisexual man, leave women alone. [audience applauding, laughing] Show of hands ladies, who here wants a bisexual man? How are you gonna be something now where half of the thing that you need to be the thing doesn’t want you? Just a faggot like the rest of us. I’ll see you at Pride. Trying to get out of that shit. Get your sunscreen out. I’ll see you at Pride. You don’t think women have enough problems? [laughs] You don’t think women go through enough? Do you know the risk a woman takes dating a man? He could kill her. She could get raped. He could snap at any fucking moment. You think she needs your gay ass bringing home AIDS? It’s gonna be a no for me, dog. It’s okay to laugh at that. It’s going to be a no for me, dog. It is sad that you guys laughed at that. I just said it, but you guys actually think it’s funny. No, that is the problem. I do this to expose. I’m telling you. Anybody, uh, here have a dick? See… [laughs] No, you guys, I’m trying to be friendlier. No, hold on, hold on. People are afraid to participate. You know, I’m approachable, right? Everybody knows this, I’m opposite Ellen. We all know this about me. No, everybody knows this. Nothing to be afraid of, okay? You know how Ellen purports to be kind and nice? But she’s actually a terror to work with. You guys have heard that. She’s a terror to work with, right? Well, I came out a little aggressive. I’m a little rough around the edges. But I’m actually a fucking delight to work with. [audience applauding, cheering] They’ll print that one day. One day it’ll come out I’m kind. Anybody here have a… have a dick? You… you caress it? You take care of it? Right? He’s a responsible individual. If… [chuckles] If something were to happen to your dick, how would you feel? Speechless. Bereft. I understand. So safe to say you love your dick? [audience member] I do. Yeah, safe to say… safe to say you love dick. [audience applauding] You’re fucking gay and it makes me sick. I don’t like no dick, mine or otherwise. No, you’re fucking gay. Happy Pride to you, faggot. [audience applauding] Everybody’s coming out tonight. Do we have any… any straight girls here? So brave. Thank you for coming forward. No, you’re all perfect the way you are. You know, I think we need the straight girl march next year. Last marginalized people on the planet, right You better believe that’s a march I go to. [laughs] Call me a fucking ally at this shit. A dyke march? I’m not going to that. Ew, this reeks. Reeks, peeew. No, straight girls it’s hard. Like, any… any single straight girls here? Any losers? No, it happens. It happens. No, it happens. It happens. It happens. ‘Cause the problem is straight girls, you know, they have to, last time I checked, they’re dating men. Right? Of course, I’ve been wrong about this before. My wife was the Bachelorette, and she had 25 boyfriends three years ago. [laughs] I have been wrong about that. For the most part, straight girls, they’re dating men. And that’s hard because men aren’t what they used to be. Right? We now have 37yearold men. We now have 37yearold men saying, “That’s so sick. That’s fire.” That’s where we’re at as a society. That’s where we’re at. You say, “That’s sick. That’s fire.” You make me fucking sick. My friend Carmen, he called me. He’s like, “Hey Rob, why didn’t you come to my birthday party?” He’s like, “Yeah, I sent you the Partiful.” I said, ‘Carm, how old are you turning?” No, I don’t go to a 39yearold grown man’s birthday party. What, are you fucking gay? Birthday parties are for women and children. What am I getting there and we’re playing “Duck, duck, goose”? What the fuck is going on? But it’s hard for women. It’s hard for everyone to date. And I realize that part of the problem is we’ve overcomplicated everything. Overcomplicated, right? We have so many apps and so many… And I’m like, “Let’s just bring it back to basics.” I came up with an equation, just a simple-I’m still working out the math, but I came up with a simple theory. You know, listen, it doesn’t matter who you’re dating, what your sexuality is, it’s for everyone. I’m for the people. You understand this. I look out for everyone. Forget the apps, forget everything. Per every relationship. Okay, let’s start there. Right. Per… This is all you need. Per every relationship, all you need is one hot… How you divvy it up, I don’t give a fuck. How you divvy it up, I don’t give a fuck. We’re used to seeing a classic example of that in this country, right? Typically, we see, like, an older, smart dude with a young, hot thing. That’s a beautiful sight. That is an American classic. That is here to stay. It’s like slipping into a pair of Calvins. It’s a beautiful sight. You ever see the opposite? You ever see, like, a pretty boy? Like an Abercrombie type with, like, a bookish, glasses-wearing type of girl? That shit can work too. A Walk to Remember, was that a fucking movie? Was that a fucking movie? How you divvy it up, I don’t give a fuck. People think in my own relationship, they think Gabby is 100% the hot circle. Right? But… but, I happen to be a bit of a cutie. Okay? I… I’m earning my keep. She’s still got 90. Calm down. She’s still got 90, but I’m earning my keep. And then for some reason, people assume that I’m 100% the smart circle. They forget Gabby was an ICU nurse for eight and a half fucking years. She’s practically a doctor in this country. We split the smart circle 5050. How you divvy it, I don’t give a fuck. Figure out your ratios, what you have, and what you fucking need. You guys are doing the ratios, so your ratios are off. You ever see two hots together? Hollywood, it’s a fucking disaster. Right? It doesn’t matter how many times JLo and Ben fucking try, and they’re gearing up to go again, it’ll never happen. You’re missing an entire circle. You ever see two smarts together? That’s a hazard on the road. Guys, come on. Be responsible. You want to be the traffic jam I was referring to? Come on. Come on. Use the math response. No, the truth is Gab is the most beautiful woman inside and out. [audience applauding, cheering] She did something rather disgusting. It happens. It happens. It happens. Right? I don’t even know really where to… I’ll just say what happened. You guys have been wonderful to me. Okay. [chuckles] I’m stalling. Okay. Okay, I caught her removing Just say what happened, Rob. Okay, I caught her removing the bathroom trash can from the bathroom. Okay, so we already… It’s already in the title there, right? So I caught her removing the bathroom trash can from the bathroom. Right? That’s where it lives. Right? You can’t just throw that into the wild of the rest of the house. It’s not domesticated. Right? So I said, “What’s going on?” And she said so casual, just in her cute Gab, just… [squeals] Just so cute. She was just so cute. She was like, “Oh, I’m just going to…” I can barely even say it. She just said, like, so casually. She was just like, “Oh, I’m just going to clip my toenails.” Which one of you sick animals here tonight clips your toenails on your living room couch? [audience laughing] That’s a sick bitch right there. That is a sick bitch right there. Always the hottest ones are sickest. I guarantee when they paint over your apartment, when they paint over your place, when you move, and they paint over your place, they’ll have to paint over anywhere between five to seven crescents… …of your fucking toenail that have lodged themselves so deep into your living room, a vacuum could never go. And she goes, “It’s okay. I catch ’em all.” She goes, “It’s okay. I catch ’em all in here.” Everybody knows a toenail goes wherever the fuck a toenail wants to go. We have no jurisdiction as mere laymen as to the trajectory of a fucking toenail. That’s why like a normal person, you get in the bathroom, you lock the door. You cut your shit and pray you don’t go blind. God forbid I should get thirsty while she’s doing this shit. And I gotta walk through the living room to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, but to be hit in the eye… …by one of her rogue nails. Between the squirt and that, I’m lucky to be alive. Thank God I wear glasses. Maybe she didn’t learn. Look. No, maybe she didn’t learn. You know, school I don’t think is a place. I never learned anything in school about how to lead a decent life. You know, I learned nothing about financial or tax planning, any domesticity, how to keep a home, so now we gotta figure shit out. And I do believe though, there’s a lesson in everything, big or small. Lesson in everything, big or small. Even the bathroom trash can. Maybe she didn’t know, right? There’s only one way to do the bathroom trash can, for instance. Okay, there’s only one way to do the bathroom trash can. That is… open concept. Waste paper basket. Don’t overthink it. Right? But some of you thought you’d get fancy going through the Target, splurge $24.99 USD on the kick lid. And you regret the day you were ever fucking born. Because the kick lid in a small… The kick lid is better suited for the larger kitchen size where you have that type of clearance. In the small… In the cramped bathroom and a small size with the lid and the spine and the heaviness and the pedal, you’re asking too much of its little body. You’re asking too much of its little body. All right, how the physics work? How are you even going to kick that from your toilet, huh? Gotta throw out your fucking hip? Right? Now you’re gonna kick this shit too hard. Haven’t had it ten days. And you’re left doing what? The… The lift and tuck. The worst feeling a person can ever know. And he knows it well. He knows it well. Every time you lift and tuck into the ether of whatever the fuck you have in your trash can, you wanna fucking die. And still you don’t take your trash out. But some of you don’t have the commitment it takes for a bathroom trash can. Some of you don’t have the commitment for a bathroom trash can to empty it regularly. Some of you will get home after tonight’s show and you’ll wipe your ass and dangle it onto a mountain you fucking created. Trying to dangle it onto a slippery bottle of Pantene Pro-V, which is too fucking big to throw out there to begin with. And still you don’t take your trash out ’cause you wanna fucking die. Some of you don’t have the commitment it takes to maintain a bathroom trash can, take it out regularly. Yet you ask me why the fuck you’re still single? If you can’t commit to a bathroom trash can, how you gonna commit to a bitch, faggot? You can’t even take the trash out for your girl, yet you want to ask me how I got the final fucking rose. [audience applauding, cheering] So it’s like, it is okay that your men are weak. For me, how I grew up. No, it’s okay that your men are weak and your women are disgusting. Because I grew up in such a house. I grew up in such a house. I grew up without a father, and my mother is the most disgusting woman in America. I had to find this out recently. My little sister got married in Vancouver. Mazel Tov, mazel Tov. And we just went out there, we went out there for the wedding. And a few days before the wedding, we did a cute, like, a girls dinner. Right? Like just me, we went out a few days before, just me, my four sisters, and my mother, no guys allowed, right? I also have five brothers. Yeah, my mother has an enormous vagina as you can imagine. That’s where I get mine from. [audience laughing, cheering] Thank you, sir, I do just fine. And we get to this chain restaurant. The dinner is off to a terrible start. Okay, my little sister, she gets back from the bathroom. There was piss all over the seat. Disgusting. I was like, “Well I don’t have the leg muscles to squat.” “So what I do when there’s piss all over the seat, the public bathroom, is I gotta wipe it down. Then I cover it, like, two, three times due to my faith. And then I relieve myself. And it kind of ends up turning into, like, a fun little game, like, going around the table with me and my sisters. Like, “Hey, what do you do when there’s piss all over the seat?” “Do you squat like her, or do you wipe it down like me?” And we get to my mother, and she’d rather not share. She’s shy about this shit. And I’m like, “Come on, Ma, we’re having girl talk.” “Come on, Ma, this is the share circle.” “Ma, what do you do when there’s piss all over the seat?” “Do you squat like her, or do you wipe it down like me?” And she goes, “Oh, okay.” “I guess I sort of just lift the seat and sit there.” [audience exclaims, laughs] She sits on the bowl. She raw dogs the bowl. You ever accidentally sit on the bowl? You’re like, “I have AIDS.” It’s like Even if that’s what this bitch does, she just heard the two only acceptable options. You’d think she’d pick one and use it going forward. She’s like, “No, I am the most disgusting woman in America.” “And what I left out was I lick it first just to make sure it’s clean.” [audience applauding, cheering] I knew I was saving something special for you.

    "transcript":"Rory Scovelonreligion One time my daughter asked me, “What happens when you die?” And I was like, “I don’t know.” And neither does anyone else. And anyone who tells you they know is lying to you. My wife was like, “Hey, why don’t we pull it back a little bit? Let’s pull it back.” “Oh, I’m sorry, babe. I was trying to create a core memory right now. I’m trying to parent. Trying to parent.” Could you imagine still going to church? It’s not even a joke. That’s not even a joke. That got an applause that… somebody like, I cannot imagine that. That what you’re asking me as a member of the audience is impossible. That’s crazy talk. I know, yes, there’s some people here who still go to church. I’m not asking you toimagineit. I’m asking the other people who at some point in their young adult life took a step back and they were just like, “It’s a scam, right?” Like, it’s… But you do go out of fear because when you’re a kid, they’re like, “If you don’t go, you don’t even want to fucking know.” And as a kid where you believe everything adults tell you, you’re like, “I I will go then.” They’re good. Cuz if you question it, you also get you fucked… you’re fucked. If you even question it, you’re fucked. Not worth it. Not worth you. An hour a week. An hour a week. If you think Jesus was white, you’re not allowed to have an opinion on gun control. Also, some people in the crowd are like, “But Jesus was white and you’re doing the best.” Remember you’re a kid, like your parents be like, “All right, we got to get ready for church, dress up.” Even as a kid, you were like, “Why does that matter?” It does. And you’ll see it when you get to heaven. You’re at the gates. God’s like, “What’d you fucking wear most of the time? Do you look like shit? Do you look like trash shit on garbage?” Also, why doesn’t God already know? “I want to hear you say it. I want to hear you say what you wore most of the time!” Second question, were you compassionate towards others? No, I’m kidding. This is Christian heaven. If that mattered, I’d be by myself up here. And Christians usually hate that part of the truth. The Pope’s closed. That’s not a red flag. That hat. Hey y’all, hold up. I forgot to put my hat on. All right. Do I look like God’s best friend or not? All the cardinals are like, “Yay! Yes, yes you do.” A lot of people say it’s uh Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. And I say to myself, I kind of wish it was Steve. I bet he would have been so dumb to talk to a snake. Women are dumb. It’s right there in the Bible. I mean, hell, Eve, do the other animals talk? They don’t. Something’s up, girlfriend. That’s a trap. Steve wouldn’t have fell for that. Steve would have been like, “What the hell is that? A talking snake? You can’t! you can’t! you can’t! you can’t! you can’t! you get out of my yard!” Steve’s already calling the Garden of Eden his yard. Get out of my yard. I saw a bumper sticker on a woman’s car. It said, “First God created man. Then he had a better idea.” Oh, did he? Did he? Did he? Did he? You dumb fuck! You were so close. And if you think God is a man, that means you think God has a dick and balls and shredded abs. Always. I don’t know why, but always. The only reason you even think that God is a man is because of all the paintings you’ve seen in history. The audacity to paint God, but also the vulnerability to paint God hot. Wow. The moment you finish that painting, like what do you think? Like, who is it? It’s God. They’re like, “Do you want to f*ck God?” Like, what? What are you talking about? Other religions don’t have that. You seen Buddha? Nobody’s fucking Buddha. All right, that’s a newer joke. Never do that at a special. I-I’ve gone to church uh thousands of times. I’ve done mushrooms maybe 30. Which of those do you think? And if you get it wrong, you have to kill yourself. Which of those do you think I talk to God the most? And if you get it wrong, you have to kill yourself. [audience] Mushrooms! Yes, mushrooms. Very good. Front row. Good placement. What I love is the whole place was like, “Well, the answer is mushrooms, right?” She was like, “I actually do know it! I actually got it!” No, she you shut up, babe. You shut up. You’re rhetorical. You’re rhetorical. You are. I don’t know what it means, and I’ll never know. And that’s my promise to myself. I’m one of those people that doesn’t believe in global warming, but I’m pretty sure Noah’s arc was a true story. You know, where the guy was warning everybody about the insane change in the weather, and everyone’s like, “Shut the fuck up, Noah! Quit hogging all the wood so you can go off and fuck those animals.” Well, that’s what it looks like. That’s what it looks like to us, dude. Looks like you’re building some kind of sex ship out there. If that’s not the case, you need to come down to the pub and you need to give a speech cuz people are talking, dude. People are fucking talking. We don’t know you. We don’t know you. You’re like a thousand. No one else is a thousand. Have you… Have you ever met someone who’s like, “I’ve read the whole Bible.” Is your first thought, “Oh my god, we should hang out.” The whole Bible? What are you doing tonight? No, I just thought Matthew wrote such a good letter to the Ephesians. And I know there’s plenty of people in here like, “Matthew didn’t write the Ephesians.” Uh, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Also, is that even right, Matthew? Matthew. That time frame, that region. Matthew. Are we fucking dumb or is that right? Hey, what’s up? I’m Matt. Um, one of Jesus’s boys. So, uh, yeah. Me and Peter. Pete. Pety Pete, get out of here, dude. Those poor people of Aphasia. Did they ever write back to him like, “Hey, we’re good. I don’t know why you… I don’t know why you sent us this.” Every day when the mail would come, like, what’ we get? It’s a… It’s another letter from that Matt guy. Why did this start? Who here knows him? Like, knows him knows him. What’s it say? Well, it’s to us from him. It just says, “He unto the moon shall lay in the field with the wife, and then unto thee shall know that the sacrificed lamb’s blood shall fill the field, and then you shall end up sewing the wheat, and unto thee you will know that amongst them they will then go among thee… Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked* Nikki Glaser hosted the 83rd Annual Golden Globes on January 11, 2026, delivering a monologue that balanced biting roasts with self-professed “fan love”.

    "transcript":"Fresh off a trip abroad, Sammy Obeid hits the mic the day America wakes up to a headline built for memes and meltdowns: Charlie Kirk has been shot. What follows is a rapid-fire, no-safe-words set about gun culture, freedom of speech colliding with the Second Amendment, and a nation that turns everything into team sports. He roasts conspiracies, skewers both camps, and mines the surreal ironies of a school event turning into a crime scene—while reminding you jokes are for the living. Smart, sharp, uncomfortable, very funny. Roll the transcript and brace for equal-opportunity offense. Premiered on September 16, 2025 (YouTube) Sammy Obeid: Who Took Charlie Kirk? | Full transcript Honolulu, September 13, 2025 Conservative activist Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Kirk gunned down. They just found the perpetrator. They’ll get to the bottom of this. If you read this, you are gay. Just flew back to America and boy, my right to bear arms is tired. America is a very unique place. You don’t realize it until you leave. I was just in Asia for three weeks, and in a lot of places there they don’t tip at all. It’s actually kind of cool. It’s another thing you don’t have to think about. But here you tip. It’s a thing. And I feel like we don’t always tip because we want to give somebody more. It’s just because we feel like they’ll hate us if we don’t. And we tip because we know somebody’s not paying them enough, so we’re kind of picking up the slack. To be honest, in some neighborhoods I tip so that I don’t get shot. I call those hollow tips. That’s a unique thing about America: America is a gun culture. You don’t find this in most places in the world. In fact, in a lot of places they just don’t have guns. If you talk about guns and shooting, they’re like, “Oh, you’re American.” That’s what comes up. I call it the American tax. We have freedom of speech, we make all the cool music, but you can get shot at any time. It’s the balance of yin and yang—which is their thing, not ours—but we took it. We like taking stuff too. I want to make this very clear: I don’t celebrate when someone dies. I don’t think that’s the way forward. I don’t think that’s the human thing to do. I do not celebrate the death of another human being. I make jokes, and there’s a difference. Jokes are not a celebration of death; they are a celebration of life while we have it. And if for a moment you think that I’m selective about this, please check my track record. Sometimes people accuse me: “Oh, you only make jokes when somebody on the right dies.” No. Biden—each time he died, I made a joke. Every single time, never skipped a beat. You might not remember that, and neither does he. When the Pope died, I was at mass making jokes: “Please forgive me for these.” When my own grandfather died, I was like, “Where’s the will?” I’m not a good person. Am I going to heaven? Probably not. But I am enjoying my life. And I know in my heart of hearts, I do not celebrate death. I just think it’s important to talk about and digest and look at why things happen so we can understand and make this world a better place. Comedy is a good vehicle for that. I honestly don’t think I should even have to explain this as a comedian—yet I do all the time. So with all that said: Charlie Kirk got assassinated. I’m not going to make any cheap shots. I see him as a human being. I didn’t agree with a lot of things he said, and I was only peripherally aware of him in the last couple years, when he became very popular. I was actually scheduled to debate Charlie Kirk. A lot of people don’t know this. Well, he didn’t know it either—but I got accepted into a community college, and that’s where he would go. Again, no disrespect. I actually value that he went to college campuses and talked to kids. I found out about this when I was in Korea. Here’s the thing about Asia or Australia, if you’ve ever been: they’re like seven, eight, nine hours behind America—but in tomorrow. It’s a very weird place to be. Here in America, you’re actually eight hours ahead of Asia, but yesterday. So you’re actually not ahead. You’re actually in the stone ages. But I woke up at 8 a.m. in South—North Korea. Actually, I was in North Korea. Just kidding. Just kidding. Just kidding. Wouldn’t that be a plot twist? I was in South Korea. It was 8:00 a.m. and my opener, Chai, yelled from the other room: “Charlie Kirk was shot.” And I was like, “Shut up, dude. Too early for jokes.” Then he sent me a photo, and I was like, “Wow, you AI-ed a montage of Twitter headlines.” And then it hit me: this actually did happen. I thought, “Wow, this is crazy. This is one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. I know this guy. I’ve seen this guy.” And I started looking into the story. Here’s the thing: you start to understand why the rest of the world sees us as the land of shootings, because they wake up and there are already a billion memes about what happened. When you hear about someone dying, most people do not naturally have the instinct to make a joke. Even myself, as a joke-maker, my first instinct is not to make a joke. That comes hours later. But I woke up and saw this after America had already processed it for eight hours. I was already seeing all the jokes. I thought, “Wow, these people move fast.” You can understand—I was dropped into this, and it was a lot to process. I watched the video. There’s a video of him getting shot. And nobody should ever have to see something like this. We as people should not be seeing this level of violence on screen. I can’t even believe that I watched it 20 times. It was too much. Too much for any person. And the fact that we subject ourselves to this is crazy. If you don’t know the backstory: Charlie Kirk is a political commentator. He associates a lot with Republicans and conservative ideology. He would often go to campuses to speak to students, which again I find very noble. I think that’s actually a very important thing to do—to stimulate dialogue at college campuses. However, schools are not the safest place to be in America. If you’re looking for a place to not get shot, I wouldn’t go to a school. You rarely hear, “There was a shooting today at Trader Joe’s.” It’s almost always at a school—and sometimes at a Walmart. That’s just how it is, and you have to know the rules. So he was at a school. What he does is engage in dialogue with the kids. He asked them questions, they talked for some time, and then the question of shootings came up. They talked about a couple other things too—like how many shooters were trans. I guess they were running out of topics. Somebody asked how many shooters are trans, and he answered that. Then somebody asked, “How many shootings have there been in America?” A general question. And he said, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” And then someone shot him. First of all, the irony: his last words were “violence.” The symbolism here is incredible. He was wearing a shirt that said “freedom.” His last words were “violence.” They were talking about school shootings while at a school—during a shooting. It was like something written onSouth Park.The levels of irony were insane. So his last words were “gang violence,” which I don’t think anybody has ever uttered as their last words before. Usually someone shouts a specific gang name: “Norte bang bang,” or “Southside [__] bang bang.” But nobody has ever said, “Gang violence.” And that’s something to unpack more. This has been a point Charlie Kirk liked to make a lot, and so do many other conservative commentators when discussing shootings:are we counting gang violence or not?I think it’s a valid question, because some sources that count mass shootings do include gang violence and some don’t. Gang violence inflates the numbers a lot. However, there’s a subtle implication—as if there still aren’t a huge number of regular shootings. And that’s a problem. Also, it’s like—can we care about the gangsters too? Crips lives matter, you know? Whatever, guys. You don’t really have gangs in Hawaii. I don’t know. Are you like, “No, we have that too”? Well, you guys have everything—in very small doses. So he shouts “gang violence,” and then someone shoots him. Instantly, as soon as Charlie Kirk got shot, the whole world tried to politicize it. That’s America’s thing. America loves to politicize everything. We politicize jeans commercials. Was she selling blue jeans or white jeans? We politicize Cracker Barrel logos. Anything you give us, we’ll be like: is that woke or anti-woke? Is that the far left or the far right? Why do we have to politicize everything? And that’s the sad part. So many Americans—maybe not in Hawaii—fall into this trap. As soon as Charlie Kirk was shot, people on the right were like, “Well, clearly it was a leftist. Clearly it was a liberal.” It’s like—first of all, you should know they don’t have great aim. You should know this by now. Liberals are not often at the shooting range working on their marksmanship. Or their marks-they-ship. Sorry. Thank you, thank you. That joke did not work in Asia for some reason. I was waiting for it to work so much. So thank you, guys. So nice to be home. Please don’t shoot. I’m also just thankful comedy is indoors, to be honest. Don’t get scared. We’re good. We’re fine. Everybody relax. But yeah, everybody politicizes. Just as well, you had people on the left like, “Yeah, got him. That’s what he deserved for saying all those things he said.” And it’s like—no. That’s equally falling into the same trap. Why do we have to politicize everything? Because politicizing, when it comes to left and right, is ultimately a gang mentality. What are the biggest gangs in America other than Republican versus Democrat? Right? So what I’m saying is the shooting technically did count as gang violence. You made it that way. I did not. That was not my choice. Now, a lot of people are saying: “Oh, are we going to go into a civil war? Is America going to go into a civil war?” First of all, we’re not civil enough for that. We can’t even nail the civil part. Maybe we’ll get to war eventually. But no, I don’t think this is a civil war. Charlie Kirk was beloved, but he was also hated by so many people. That’s not enough unanimity. We’re not the United States. We’re states. Be honest about what we are. I don’t think we can even agree on who we want to fight over. Also, if we had a civil war in today’s world, the main fighting class would have to be Gen Z. I just don’t see that happening. It would be like, “Bang bang, you’re dead ass. No cap.” I will say though, it is kind of nice to see Republicans finally caring about a school shooting. I will say that. And people ask me, “Well, how did you feel about Charlie Kirk? You heard all the things he said.” It’s like—Charlie Kirk was younger than me. He could have been my younger brother. He was younger than me and a lot more successful. So of course I hated him. Of course I hated him. That doesn’t mean… You should already know that I’m against violence. Have you not seen my other material? People get outraged when I make jokes about a shooting. Like—have you not seen my genocide material? I saw this news in Korea, and in Korea it was already 9\/11. For you guys, this happened on 9\/10. But for me, it was 9\/11. And I know you don’t relate, because for you it was 9\/10. But you know—on 9\/10 it’s 9\/11 somewhere. So the messed-up thing is I knew this was an important event that had to be talked about. I instantly put together a set and did it that night, on 9\/11, in Tokyo. We recorded it and I posted it on this app. It was taken down within 24 hours—actually within 16 hours—for bullying. Which is a bit ironic considering this particular story. But here’s the thing: I know the community guidelines. I read them before bed every night. And unlike America, my takes are very civil. My whole thing was just like: hey, let’s look at this from a bigger perspective, and let’s not preach violence. Meanwhile, if you’ve been on the internet, there are some wild takes out there. From both left and right—just really violent stuff. And it’s like, you’re takingmyvideo down? Preaching togetherness? Dude, people are saying really insensitive jokes. And imagine how many Halloween costumes there are going to be this year. It’s going to be a lot. I’m just saying I’m not the bad guy. I think it’s important to see every human as a human. It’s also fair to evaluate what somebody has said in their life. If you want to honor somebody and only look at the good things on the day of their funeral, that’s your right. But we should also be honest about what somebody said; otherwise we’ll never learn anything. The truth is Charlie Kirk said a lot of inflammatory things about many people. If you look at some of the harshest things he said, a lot of it was about Islam. He said things about Black people. I’m not Black, so I can’t speak for how Black people feel about what he said, but as someone from a mostly Muslim family, hearing him say things like “Islam is the seed of evil,” basically saying Islam is ruining America and needs to be stopped—that’s rough. Occasionally he’d say, “There’s a few good Muslims,” like, “Am I one of the good ones? Did I make the cut?” If you saw some of his tweets about Islam, your first thought might be, “Oh, a Muslim probably did this.” Not saying you would have been right, but I understand why someone might think that. I truly believe in freedom of speech. I respect that Charlie Kirk believed in it and was literally willing to die for it. But we learned that freedom of speech only goes so far. The government gives you only so much freedom of speech, and you only have so much freedom to say things before it catches up to you. That’s a truth we need to acknowledge because we live in a country with the Second Amendment. I’m not arguing here whether we should take it away or keep it. As long as we have the Second Amendment, remember we put the First Amendment first for a reason—but the Second is second for a reason, because sometimes the second catches up to the first. Sometimes you should plead the Fifth and shut the hell up. That’s my philosophy. I’m not against guns, per se—I think the concept of a gun as a killing machine was a mistake. But as long as we have guns, either everybody should have them or nobody should. We shouldn’t be arbitrarily picking and choosing who gets them—maybe with some specific restrictions. Here’s how I feel about gun control: every time there’s a massive act of gun violence, our country divides. Half the country says, “Get rid of all the guns.” The other half says, “We need more guns,” and that’s it—guns with little guns that battle it out. We’ll never know which theory works until we try both. That’s how science works: control and variable. The United States is perfect for that because we’re not united—we’re states. We have 50 states—51 if you count Israel—and a lot of room to experiment. I think we should pick a state to try the no-guns thing and a state to try the all-guns thing. I’m not the governor of Hawaii, but Hawaii seems like a good place to try no guns—if you want to kill someone in Hawaii, you probably just need therapy: go to the beach, sip a coconut, you’ll be fine. For the all-guns experiment, I volunteer Alaska. Alaska already has a high rate of gun violence because it’s mostly bears—bear-on-bear violence. Alaska has a bunch of problems already; it also has a high rate of nonconsensual sex. Disgusting. You’d think the opposite would be true given the state’s name, but it’s not. So send more guns to Alaska. Arm the bears. Give the bears the right to bear arms and see what happens. We’re at the point now where we have so many shootings that we have shooters of every different kind of identity. The topic that came up right before Charlie Kirk died was how many trans shooters there have been in America. Why are we even asking that question? The fact that trans people are such a small demographic and that we already have trans shooters actually says a lot. It’s very progressive. I support trans shooter rights. My take is unpopular because I’m not anti-gun and I’m pro-trans—those two don’t often go together. For the sake of argument, I’m pro-gun and pro-trans, and only Arizona agrees with that. So much so that I bought a transgender gun. Yeah, it’s a sought-off shotgun. I ran that joke by my trans friend; they loved it. They’re also a comedian, so maybe not the best barometer. Then you had a lot of people reacting with, “I didn’t like the guy, but now I’m scared.” Dude, you should have been scared before all this. There have been school shootings this whole time. They’re all important and need to be stopped. Rest in peace, Charlie Kirk. But just because it was an adult this time doesn’t mean we suddenly care—America doesn’t give a shit about kids, man. It also bothers me that after this happens, all politicians, left and right, have the same sound bite: “There is no place for political violence in this country.” There is no place for any violence, bro. Schools are getting shot up; you’re voting to send money to bomb kids overseas. Stop doing that too. If you’re a politician and you’re worried violence is coming to your doorstep, maybe stop exporting it all over the world with your policies. If you don’t get why what goes around comes around, then maybe get educated. Do some research. Now on to solving this crime. I’m a private detective. There were a lot of suspicious things. The shot was made at long range, which sparked debate. The first talking point was: a long-range shot like that has to be a professional job. Then hunters came out of the woodwork saying they do that all the time. I don’t know who to believe at this point. What’s crazy is a couple things: right after they shot Charlie, they immediately zoned in on an old guy who became the fall guy. He apparently said, “Yeah, I did it.” You look over and it’s this old guy—like, is that the guy? He said, “It was me.” After three hours of focusing on him, they admitted, “No, it’s actually not that guy at all.” That left time for the shooter to get away. My first thought was the shooter shot at the exact same time the subject of shootings came up—was the person who asked the question in on it? That felt very coordinated. But then the student who asked the question posted that he was the one who asked it and said he felt bad—he saw it right in front of him. As a detective, he checks out. I don’t think he was in on it; he was a student in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the irony stands: did the shooter wait until that came up just to be extra ironic? If so, they heard it from 200 yards away, so credit to the sound system. It could also have been a total coincidence, which is even bonkers. Everybody immediately assumed this had to be done with experience and planning. Every group of people sat behind their laptops thinking, “Please don’t let it be ours. Please don’t let it be ours.” I know Charlie Kirk said vicious things about Muslims, but please don’t make this a halal shooter. We were all behind screens: “Please, please, please don’t let it be us.” Then everyone could relax: it was a white guy. “Oh my god, thank you so much.” His name is Tyler—that’s a white name. As soon as they said “Tyler,” I was like, “All right, we’re good.” I didn’t even need to see him. You know, I get it — a Black person can be Tyler, too. But it’s not Tyler, the Creator. It’s Tyler, the Destroyer in this case. As soon as we confirmed the race, the next question was: what is his political party? It became a gender-reveal–style anticipation: what’s gonna come out — red or blue? That’s how it is in America. We get tense over the political-party reveal of the most recent shooter. Everybody on the right was like, “It’s going to be a leftist — a blue-haired lesbian.” And on the left they were like, “Please, please just make it a regular gun owner. Please, please just make it a normal conservative gun owner.” It turned out to be Tyler — politically ambiguous. People try to spin it both ways. His family is Republican, but he wasn’t necessarily registered Republican. He had some conservative viewpoints and some antifascist, more leftist viewpoints. He dressed all in black, so he’s goth. His shirt had an American flag, so it’s everyone’s fault. He wore Chuck Taylors — kind of 90s gangster—Chucks on the way to kill. Messed up. Everyone tried to twist the narrative on Tyler. Some said he went to college and was radicalized by leftist professors — but he did one semester during COVID, so really blame the lockdowns if you want a scapegoat. Others guessed he had to be LGBTQ because Charlie Kirk was against that. It turns out he came from a Republican family, so he must be gay — I’m kidding. His dad turned him in. That’s how you know it’s a white family. Brown kids, we don’t even talk to our parents — my parents didn’t know my girlfriend’s name for three years. But Tyler and his dad were close enough that his dad turned him in. I feel horrible for the parents who discover their kid did this. At least they got him out of the house; older parents know how hard that is. It’s tough to get millennials and Gen Z out. Here’s where it gets weird: Tyler engraved words onto the casings. As soon as his picture came out, most people’s first thought was, “Not as hot as Luigi.” Luigi is hard to follow for shootings — a legend. But Tyler wrote things on the casings: some antifascist messages, one related to LGBTQ, and one that said, “If you’re reading this, you are gay. LMAO.” That was basically a direct assault on the Utah police — the forensics team on this is Utah police, so take that as you will. If the casing reads, “If you are reading this, you are gay, LMAO,” it could have been any one of my friends. I don’t know if it’s Brad or Chad, but they love gay jokes. A kid from Tyler’s high school said, “I went to school with Tyler.” He was a Reddit guy. I feel bad for Reddit boys today — a loss for Redditors. If there’s one app contributing to shootings, it’s probably Reddit or 4chan — right up there with 4chan. Even after identifying Tyler, things stayed suspicious. Immediately when they identified the suspect, the governor of Utah came out saying, “We got him.” I’m already like, “Okay, that’s very suspicious that he’s so confident they got him.” There’s footage of the event that shows a lot of odd things. If you saw behind Charlie Kirk, some of his bodyguards and people were doing strange hand signals right before it happened—either they were really bad ASL interpreters or they were potentially signaling that something might happen. People also noted the scope on the rifle the shooter allegedly used, which was found in the bushes, was placed in a weird way. It would have been quite miraculous for someone to make that shot. Others said the scope can get messed up when you drop a rifle. Again, I can’t confirm any of that—I don’t quite have the scope for this, let’s just say. Another strange thing: shortly after the shooting, a private jet took off 12 minutes down the road from the college, illegally disabled its radar while in the sky, then came back and landed in Provo a couple hours later. They later released the flight log saying, “Oh, it just went to Arizona then came back.” But why disable the radar at just the right time for somebody to potentially do an airdrop? So, yeah—trust the government. There were other oddities. Netanyahu tweeted a little too soon at the exact same time as Trump—3:02 p.m.—both saying they were praying for Charlie Kirk. Netanyahu tagged Charlie Kirk for some reason; his intern needs to be fired. Shortly after, Netanyahu made a long post about Charlie Kirk saying things like “we all know this was probably done by radical Muslims,” which is weird. Nobody’s out here saying, “Salam, Tyler.” Never met a Muslim named Tyler, buddy. That was super sus. You have to look into this because a lot of it is circulating right now. In his last weeks, Charlie Kirk confided to one of his best friends that he was afraid Israel might kill him if he turned on them—that’s been said on record. There were a few live interviews where he talked about frustrations with people from Israel turning on him because he was becoming more of a skeptic. Charlie Kirk was very pro-Israel until the last few weeks of his life, when he started showing slight seedlings of an awakening, similar to Candace Owens or Tucker Carlson—who I love, by the way. I don’t care what you say: Tucker Carlson is doing God’s work right now. He’s reaching a demographic your platforms never would. I don’t care what he said in the past. I’m in love with Tucker Carlson right now. Do not ruin it for me. When he laughs, I come. I love this man. You could potentially see the seedlings of awakening in Charlie Kirk in these last few weeks: he started to question Mossad’s role in the Epstein files. I’m not going to say much more because I’m also scared. Epste—if you didn’t know—was a creepy guy who enjoyed “massages,” if you know what I mean. He wasn’t good to women; he was a misogynist. Charlie Kirk demanded the release of the Epstein list—Trump does not want that. He was suggesting Epstein might have been intelligence and perhaps working for Mossad. He questioned whether October 7th was an inside job, as some who study the facts now suggest. He told Meghan Kelly he was getting criticism from Israelis and that people in Israel were coming after him. He confided to a friend that he was afraid Israel would kill him. That’s a giant red flag. Would Israel do an assassination? They’re so busy with genocide right now—I don’t know if they have the time. Rest in peace, JFK. I don’t think they would do something like this, but some people are saying they are. Not me. Not me. Charlie Kirk said he was afraid of Israel. Somebody said Trump expressed similar fears because of how strong AIPAC is in Congress. Charlie Kirk feared Israel. Trump feared Israel. I’m afraid of Israel. The only people not afraid of Israel are Palestinians. Palestinians are the last frontier of people who are not afraid to stand up to Israel. The irony is this relates to Gaza because of what’s happening there and because of the Epstein files. One day before Charlie Kirk, we were all waiting for the release of the Epstein files—the creepy birthday book had just been released—and everybody was asking, “Where are the files?” Even Charlie was asking. Then boom, it’s over: we’re all focused on Charlie Kirk. While we were paying attention to that case, Congress voted on a measure to not release the Epstein files—the Republicans voted to block release. All while we weren’t paying attention. I don’t know. It kind of adds up. I do math. It kind of adds up. These are all just conspiracies. It could have just been Tyler. On one hand, was it Israel and Trump coordinating to cover up the Epstein files, the genocide, and everything going on with the Israel lobby? Or was it just a white guy named Tyler from Utah who said, “You are gay”? I don’t know. I honestly don’t even know anymore. I already posted a video with my takes on it, and I pissed off a lot of people. Some said, “This is so insensitive to be making jokes at this time”—and these are typically the free-speech people, which is annoying. Then I pissed off leftists who were like, “You’re being too moderate, calling Charlie Kirk a human. He was a Satan Nazi.” Bro, we can’t keep up this divisiveness. The more we preach partisan division, the more it’s going to kill us. It’s literally like getting shot, your insides spilling out, and you see your intestines for the first time. You think, “Gross,” so you cut them out—only to realize you die without them. Just because something seems foreign, ugly, or different doesn’t mean it isn’t vital to our existence. Don’t try to play God. You’re not a surgeon. Even though I disagreed with so many things Charlie Kirk said, I respect that he went to schools and engaged in dialogue with people who disagreed with him. I respect that he believed in freedom of speech and was willing to die for it. And I think he manifested the whole thing because he wanted to be a martyr. You could hear it in his tone. He wore a shirt that said “freedom” in his last days. Yes, he was very pro-Israel for much of his life. But let’s be honest: if he got killed by Israel, he died like a Palestinian. And here’s some irony—if Israel did do this (not saying they did, but if they did), then they technically did two 9\/11s. It was 9\/10 for you, but it was 9\/11 somewhere. I’m not saying they did that. Of course, if Israel wanted to do that, they would have just bombed the whole school. Don’t kill the messenger. I know this is dark, and we’re all processing in our own ways. But while we’re alive, let’s celebrate life. Enjoy the jokes before they get taken down again. Thank you so much for coming out. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

    "transcript":"Comedian Sammy Obeid’s 2025 special “The Epstein ‘Philes” humorously tackles Jeffrey Epstein’s controversial death. Obeid critiques the slow news cycle, calling out government secrecy and conspiracy theories suggesting powerful figures’ involvement. He mocks key players like Trump, Kash Patel, and Pam Bondi, highlighting inconsistencies in the Epstein files’ handling, including doctored prison surveillance tapes with missing footage. Obeid links Epstein’s dark past to intelligence agencies and international elites, referencing connections to Saudi figures and Mossad. Combining comedy with serious insights, he stresses society’s failure to proactively address pedophilia and institutional protection. The special blends sharp satire with deep concerns over justice and transparency in Epstein’s case. Premiered July 21, 2025 Sammy Obeid: The Epstein ‘Philes | Full transcript Do you guys remember where you were when Jeffrey Epstein died? Oh, sorry — died. I’m sorry. Hey, Dad. This disclaimer — you don’t think about this. No, not at all. Heads up: I’m going to be talking about Jeffrey Epstein for like 20 minutes. Yikes. Wrong show. I have to because Trump tweeted, “Stop talking about Epstein” in all caps. So I said, I’m going to do a whole special on it. And what better place than a movie theater in New Hope. Welcome to my screening of the documentaryThe Epstein Files Unraveled in Minnesota.Sorry we couldn’t do this in Duluth. I apologize. I feel like it would have been better received there. The Epstein files — which were definitely a missed opportunity to call themThe Pedophiles.Just saying, comedy’s comedy. I’m against pedophilia, by the way. I hope I make that statement very clear here. The reason I’m talking about this: there are a lot of reasons and I’ll tell you later, but number one is I’m against pedophilia and I think you should be too. I think that’s why we should be talking about exactly this issue right now. When Jeffrey Epstein disappeared, I was in Cleveland, so I don’t know who had it worse that night, but I told that joke in Cleveland. They loved it. They got it. I’ve been trying to piece these things together because I wasn’t really paying attention back then — this happened in 2019 when he disappeared from his jail cell. That seems like the before times, right? 2019 was ages ago. We even named a disease after it and then we moved on and our lives have changed in the last six years alone. I think about how fast the news cycle moves now. It’s incredible. We’re at a higher frequency, but not in a good way. Think about how many things have happened this year that shouldn’t be eventful but were eventful — like the Super Bowl halftime. That was huge this year. It was crazy that a famous person basically said straight up in public about another person, “he likes him young.” It was crazy when Elon did that to Trump. This whole year is basically the Super Bowl halftime. That’s what it is. I’m just waiting for the Palestine protestor to show up and hold up the Palestine and Sudan flag. The Trump administration said they were going to release the Epstein files and then suddenly they did not. I’m still trying to figure out why. It’s almost as if they’re trying to protect someone. I would just need like 20 more photos of that person with Jeffrey Epstein to get an idea who it is. I’ve seen about 80 so far, but I need 20 more to give myself the full 100. You know what I mean? The hundo. Yeah. But Kash Patel — who sounds like a motel chain. All right, that’s a racist joke, okay if you understand it. Who wouldn’t like a cash-only motel chain? That’d be pretty cool. He has career options if he resigns, is all I’m saying. Kash Patel was on Joe Rogan like a month ago, and this is when I knew something was very off because he was very adamant about releasing the files a couple months ago and then suddenly he was saying, “Joe, I don’t have the client list.” Like, don’t you think if I had the client list I would release it? No — you’re assuming we trust you, which we do not. You work for the FBI — that’s like the last agency we trust after all the other government ones. And then he was using very suspicious body language during that interview. He had these nervous twitches when he was like, “Bro, I’m telling you it was a suicide. You know it’s suicide when you see one.” Like — why? Why did you just sniff? You weren’t doing cocaine before this. Why did you just sniff? Super suspicious. Also, side note: his girlfriend might be an Israeli spy. We don’t know yet. We’re still looking into it. So that’s Cash Mattel. Then you got Bondi and Bonino, which sounds like an Italian law firm. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in February, “I have the Epstein files on my desk.” And then they asked her like a week ago and she’s like, “I don’t even have a desk. What are you talking about? I never said Epstein files. No, I said I had Epsom salts. That’s what I said. I had Epsom salts and I was about to take an Epsom salt bath.” And so now because they completely botched this whole situation, Cash Patel is now saying, “If Pam Bondi doesn’t resign, I will.” You know, and Bonino’s like, “I might resign too.” It’s like all y’all motherers need to resign. Okay? You’ve all been compromised. Don’t you understand? Now, if you’re not fully aware by now, Trump and Epstein were boys. Okay? They were boys. They even had a musical group together. It was called the Island Boys. I’m an island boy. That was their first hit. Don’t look it up. You won’t be satisfied either way. But yeah, Trump and Epstein were friends. Now Trump tries to pretend like he’s not as much of a friend as Jeffrey Epstein said they were because Jeffrey Epstein claimed in an interview that him and Trump were best friends for a decade. And if you look at the pictures, it really looks like that. But Trump says that’s not the case. And I’m not saying believe Jeffrey Epstein, but I’m saying if it’s between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, I’m going with the dead guy. Trump’s side of the story is Trump says that he stopped being friends with Epstein. In fact, Trump’s team says they banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2007 for being creepy. Do you know how creepy you have to be to get banned from Mar-a-Lago? That’s an insane level of creepiness. Obviously Trump has a perfect track record with women, but Trump has a lot of accusations against him. He’s probably got like a hundred or so accusations against him, but Epstein has like a thousand. So we’re talking like a power-of-ten difference in levels of creepiness. Sorry, math is involved. Not only is Trump pretending he didn’t know the guy, there was a conference where Trump was sitting with Pam Bondi and they were asking her about Epstein and he interjected. He’s like, “Are you guys talking about Jeffrey Epstein?” It’s like, “No, his brother Mark. Who do you think?” Just totally pretending like he didn’t know the guy. And we’re not falling for it. He tweeted like 10 times last week, like, “Stop talking about Epstein. It’s a hoax. Why are you guys still talking about Epstein? I’m not thinking about Epstein. Why are you guys thinking about Epstein? I’ve moved on. I’m so moved on from Epstein. Why are you guys still talking about it?” Even weirder: his supporters are like, “You know what? He’s right. We cared about Epstein so much, but you know what? He’s our president and by God I believe what he says.” So let him get back to draining the swamp that’s inside of him right now. Let him get back to draining the swamp that appears to be only inside of his head. People always say that Trump dog whistles and I’m starting to get that now because people are defending him, like, “Come on, if Trump was in the Epstein files, don’t you think that Biden would have released it to get him?” It’s like, no, because Biden’s in that mother too. Do you not get it? They’re all in on this. And even if Biden’s not in it directly, one of his friends is—Bill Clinton. Somebody in the very small circle or oval, I should say. It’s somebody. It’s somebody there. Honestly, I don’t think that Biden was on Epstein Island because that’s a lot of plain stairs to go up and down. I don’t think he’s equipped for that. I think Epstein was like, “We don’t do liability waivers. I don’t think we can have this guy.” It just makes you realize how creepy all of our presidents are, right? It’s basically confirmed that Trump’s a pedophile. Biden was sniffing young girls’ hair. That’s not good. But hopefully that’s just where it stopped. And then Bill Clinton was Bill Clinton. And then I know liberal crowds get mad when I bring up Obama, but he did have some, you know, I guess allegations that he was doing some fellatio for some drugs once. I’m not going to put that rumor out there, but he did drone strike Syria. So I’m going to put the rumor out there just for tonight. It really just makes you appreciate George W. Bush just a little bit. Just a little bit. You know what I mean? I get it. George W. Bush, horrible person, right? Iraq war, decades of pointless conflict. But family man. A little cocaine. A little cocaine family man. You know what I mean? He couldn’t go to Epstein. He was doing art at home. So Trump’s almost definitely implicated. Elon seems to have some inside information here. I don’t like a lot of things Elon does and says, but I don’t think he’s lying. I don’t think Ketamine makes you lie. He’s basically the only private detective we have left in this situation. He’s our special—he’s special K detective. Special K unit. He’s out there like, and then we’re going to go directly to Mars. And by the way, the big beautiful bill is not beautiful at all because if it was I would have asked it to bear my child. It’s one big show. We don’t know exactly who all of the people were who associated with Epstein aside from all the very detailed flight logs. We don’t know all the people, but we do know that somebody in the government considered him a good hang. I mean, take all the time you want with that one. It takes a little while for the oxygen to leave the brain. So we’ll take our dear time. We don’t have the conclusive evidence that we want or need. So I think the best next step is to check the surveillance tapes of Jeffrey Epstein’s prison cell. Maybe that’ll give us a good hint as to what happened. Does anybody have access to those tapes? Oh, they’re actually released to the public. Awesome. Oh, there’s a missing minute. You don’t say. There was a missing minute in the surveillance tapes released directly to us from the DOJ, our trusted father. Now, here’s the crazy thing. They say that the surveillance tape system at Jeffrey Epstein’s high-security prison was from the ’90s. It was very old school. They recorded on VHS, I guess, and it had just one track audio. Apparently the video system needs to reset every night right around midnight, which is the time that Jeffrey Epstein was allegedly killed and that his cellmates nearby said they heard someone visiting at the prison cell. Right around that time is when the tapes just stop for a minute. And I believe the government because with the budgets right now, it’s hard to get updates on your video surveillance, especially for high-security prisons like that. Isn’t that crazy? They expect us to believe that a high-security prison is using a video surveillance system from the ’90s in 2019. The government can spy on us in 4K, but it can’t record federal prisons in more than 720p. And so there’s a missing minute. That’s what at a conference a reporter was asking Pam Bondi. He’s like, “Hey, what’s up with that missing minute?” She’s like, “Yeah, we’re looking into that. We just have to check with the prison to see if the tapes reset every night like that. So we’re just checking. Let us know. They haven’t told you yet.” She’s like, “They haven’t got back to us. They use voicemail, so their voicemail box was full, basically, so they’re going to let us know.” Then it turned out the news came out about a week ago that the tape was doctored. Yes. The tape was fabricated by we don’t know who, but whoever it was, they used Adobe Premiere. Shout out brand loyalty. If anything, this was a big L for DaVinci Resolve because they’re like, damn, we could have had that credit. The FC tapes, that’s huge. Somebody determined they stitched together two different video tracks and two different audio tracks using Adobe Premiere. Shout out to Adobe. Good job. But not shout out to Microsoft because he was there. Open the gates of hell. They used Adobe Premiere and they stitched together this tape and I find it kind of inspiring how technology has improved over the years. Somebody in the government made this tape in 2019 thinking they’re not going to figure this out. I have the latest edition of Adobe Premiere. I just did the 2019 software update. They’ll have no idea what happened. Six years later, they had no idea that AI was going to take everybody’s job and be like, “That’s a fake.” Then it came out a few days later that it wasn’t even a missing minute. It was a missing 2 minutes, 53 seconds. That’s a game changer, right? Because beforehand people were like, “Well, it’s just a minute.” Even said that like a minute historically was enough for Jeffrey Epstein to get finished. But 2 minutes 53 seconds—you can kill like five people in that time. I wouldn’t have known personally. I’m just saying it’s a lot of time for the tape to go blank. So is he dead? We’ll find out. Actually, I’m going to reveal at the very end. We know for a fact that some video editor proficient in Adobe Premiere was sitting behind a screen deleting something that happened that night, some strange thing that happened that night right outside of Jeffrey Epstein’s prison cell and then stitched together things with apparently no guilty conscience. So a human being literally removed something that could implicate this and bring justice to this whole situation. They removed it and stitched the video together in a complete fabrication to trick the general public into seeing something that did not in fact happen. I think we need to find that editor and I would like to hire him because that is amazing work. That is amazing work. A lot of the times I tell a joke and certain parts don’t work and I would just like to cut it out. But my editors, they don’t know how to do the crossfades and merge the two audio tracks together. Honestly, this joke’s not doing as well as I hope. So I’m going to edit in laughter later. I’m going to stitch together another audio track. So if you know that editor, shout out. Give him my number. The world at this point wants to see the Epstein files. Here’s what I realized. I really don’t think there are Epstein files. I think the government has a lot of information and some of it they’re not releasing, but I think most of it already exists on this place called the internet. So if you want to see the Epstein files, I looked at them. It’s called Wikipedia. Just Wikipedia Jeffrey Epstein and you’ll basically see enough. You’ll see more than you even want to know. I’ll tell you that much. So what I’m saying is I read the Epstein files and I’m releasing them here tonight in New Hope at my screening:The Epstein Files Uncensored.Footnote: we had to double-check this on Wikipedia. I am against pedophilia. I think we need to be doing more as a society to stop it. We’re not in this country. When people get an offense for pedophilia, they get put on a list. That’s insane. That’s not proactive. We need to stop people before anything happens. I have an idea. I think we all need to go down to the grocery store and watch who’s buying their bananas green. Think about it. Those aren’t ready yet, but they still want them. These are the people we need to be watching out for—the green banana buyers. I see some angry faces. I buy my bananas green. Well, you’re a pedophile now. We know. Buy the bananas yellow like a normal adult or with the brown spots if you like them mature. Know how to do it. Get the bananas the correct way. Furthermore, this country has an institutionalized system of protecting pedophiles and we need to become aware of it and call it out. It needs to stop now. And to all the people saying, “Well, Jeffrey Epstein got away with it just because he was rich and famous”—like, “No, then why is Jared from Subway still in jail?” And anybody who’s studied this Epstein case—or I mean read the Wikipedia article—would know that this goes beyond powerful people just trying to protect a single pedophile. There’s intelligence involved. There’s central intelligence involved. If only there was an agency that would be in charge of central intelligence, maybe we could figure out who the culprit is here. Okay, I’m talking about the CIA, guys. The CIA— I don’t know if you know about this institution—but they’ve done a lot over the years and a lot of the people who work for the CIA are horrible people, and some of them convicted pedophiles and some of them are pedophiles that were never prosecuted. Look it up. There have been CIA officers historically that were not charged for pedophilia. CIA actually stands for “can’t identify age.” It’s absolute— We know that this goes even beyond the CIA. We know it goes beyond our intelligence. And if you look at the case, you would know a foreign entity is involved. Now, I don’t want to depress you guys with conspiracy theories that might make you most sad, but there’s enough evidence now that it’s not a conspiracy. It is real. It is real. It is real. It is real. It is real. Nothing to see here, folks. I do have to be careful talking about this because if I talk too much about Epstein, his lawyer could still come after me. Isn’t that crazy? Epstein’s dead, but his lawyer is still active for him: Alan Dershowitz. You guys know Alan Dershowitz? Sleazy guy. He was recorded to be on Epstein’s island. He has allegations against him, and he’s still Epstein’s lawyer. So if I talk too much about Epstein, I could get sued by Alan Dershowitz. For the same reason, I can’t talk too much about Israel. If I talk too much about the Israel–Epstein connection, Israel’s lawyer could come after me. Also Alan Dershowitz—how many more clues do you need? Okay, but it’s just a theory, right? It’s just a theory supported by a lot of facts at this point, because all the things add up. All of this happened to happen right when Netanyahu was coming to the United States to do his laundry. That’s what he does every time. He brings his dirty laundry. Once you start to put it together, you realize the whole Epstein sex-trafficking thing was not just about one extremely perverted man. It was about a whole operation to gather intel on powerful people. Jeffrey Epstein had surveillance cameras in his house—much better than the ones in his prison, ironically. There are thousands of hours of tape out there somewhere that have not been stitched together in Adobe Premiere. They haven’t even been exported yet. When you connect the dots, which I did one night, you realize it all points back to Israel. That’s why sometimes people ask, “Why are you talking about Epstein so much?” It’s like, bro, I talk about Palestine. I truly, obviously want to free Palestine. The things holding back free Palestine are the lying media, AIPAC buying our politicians, misinformation campaigns. There’s all sorts of levels to the movement trying to prevent Palestine from becoming free. But I’m telling you now: the Epstein Files is the final boss. The Epstein Files is the final boss because it’s controlling the most powerful people. Look at when Palestine almost became free in the ’90s with Oslo. Who was brokering that deal? Bill Clinton, right? And now who’s basically letting the takeover of the West Bank happen and the repopulating of Gaza and initiating that? Trump—who was his bud. So all of the signs point to this, and that’s why I was up on Wikipedia all night last night trying to gather information on when Epstein turned from just a person into a spy. There were many points where Epstein told other people he was intelligence. There’s instances where he even said he was Mossad. For those who don’t know, Mossad is Israel’s intelligence agency, and they’re like everywhere. There’s probably like two of them here tonight. Hi. Say hi for the camera. But yeah, I was trying to figure out when this all happened. He went to Israel a bunch of times. He actually went to Israel during one of the times when he was on parole or probation. He spent a lot of time in Israel because he was legally allowed to go there. Israel basically has a system where pedophiles can escape from other countries and take safe haven there. It’s only offered to Jewish citizens of Israel. It’s not Muslims. I’m pointing this out because that shows how up Israel is. They’ve even apartheid-ed pedophilia. So if you didn’t know, now you know. Okay. Was that a phone call? That’s so scary. That was like an old-school phone—ring ring ring. It’s the FBI. It’s just Kash Patel on the other line. I wanted to look up who Jeffrey Epstein actually was, and I looked him up. Jeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, which is one of the five boroughs that Azor An won, actually. Figured I’d perk you guys up for a second before we get into the dark. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly had what was considered a normal childhood, which is the first red flag. Parents, do not give your kids a normal childhood. Give them some trauma like the rest of us. It levels the playing field. This guy got both his parents’ love for the whole term. Don’t do that. I’m not telling you what to do, but give him a little adversity—be verbally abusive. Gaslighting is perfectly okay for a parent. Epstein’s parents loved him, and they even had a nickname for him: they called him “Bear.” That’s probably why he grew up to think he was qualified for a honeypot operation. That’s the operation he was doing. It’s called a honeypot operation when they try to attract people with something they think they like. That’s what he did. Jeffrey Epstein finished high school at 16—which again, don’t do that. Make sure your kids experience prom. He took advanced math courses in college, which I’m not proud of. He studied math—physiological math, which is the creepiest math out there. It’s the math of the human body. Don’t mix those two things. He didn’t finish college. Thank God I don’t have the same degree as him. He then taught at the Dalton School in New York, a popular school, and he got that job from a guy named Donald (not Trump) but Donald Barr—yes, who happens to be the father of William Barr, the attorney general during the Epstein case. I’m not saying there’s a conspiracy, just what a coincidence. I know stats. I majored in math. What are the chances? Of course this is all covered up. If you try to Google the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and former Attorney General Bill Barr, you won’t get much because all you’ll get is unrelated articles on the Epstein-Barr virus, which is different. There’s a virus called the Epstein-Barr virus that has nothing to do with these guys. It’s a completely different Epstein and a completely different Barr, but also somehow a virus. It’s actually herpes, which is proof this is not going away for a long time. Needs to be treated. Sorry if you’re not liking these jokes. I’ll raise the bar. People said that Epstein was a creepy teacher, which is shocking. He would actually show up at students’ parties and try to talk to them and hang out with them. So he got fired for that behavior, which shows there’s actually justice in academia sometimes. The Dalton School in the ’70s. You can envision Epstein being like, “Oh man, I can’t just talk to the students freely. I wish I had my own island for this.” And then he did. The signs were there. He studied the creepy math. He was a creepy teacher. Then he gets an island on the Virgin Islands. Come on, dude. The signs were there—there’s “teen” in his name, Epstein. The signs were there, is what I’m saying. So he left academia and became a day trader, which is how it starts for a lot of evil people, and he got fired for a violation there. This guy keeps taking L’s and then he becomes a consultant, which—let’s face it—is not a real job. It’s like, just become a therapist if you want to talk to people. A lot of consultants in here. That’s fine. He became a consultant in the ’80s, and this is where things started to get weird because during this time he would actually tell people that he was intelligence and he told people that he was a foreign spy. He was found to have foreign passports from that time; one listed his birthplace as Saudi Arabia. This checks out because he did a lot of business in Saudi Arabia in the ’80s. In fact, in the ’80s one of his biggest clients—so we know he had clients back then—consulting clients, of course—was a guy named Adnan Khashoggi, a prominent figure in Saudi Arabia who worked with Epstein to basically finance the Iran–Contra affair in the ’80s, where Israel funneled weapons into Iran to spur a regime change, which is not relevant to now at all. Epstein was at the forefront of financing that whole operation with Adnan Khashoggi. During this time Epstein became acquainted with a lot of people in Saudi Arabia. It was later revealed, according to Epstein, that he was friends with MBS, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Can you turn off the tapes for this one? People said that Epstein was a creepy teacher, which is shocking. He would actually show up at students’ parties and try to talk to them and hang out with them. So he got fired for that behavior, which shows there’s actually justice in academia sometimes. The Dalton School in the ’70s. You can envision Epstein being like, “Oh man, I can’t just talk to the students freely. I wish I had my own island for this.” And then he did. The signs were there. He studied the creepy math.

In fact, in the ’80s one of his biggest clients—so we know he had clients back then—consulting clients, of course—was a guy named Adnan Khashoggi, a prominent figure in Saudi Arabia who worked with Epstein to basically finance the Iran–Contra affair in the ’80s, where Israel funneled weapons into Iran to spur a regime change, which is not relevant to now at all. Epstein was at the forefront of financing that whole operation with Adnan Khashoggi. During this time Epstein became acquainted with a lot of people in Saudi Arabia. It was later revealed, according to Epstein, that he was friends with MBS, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Can you turn off the tapes for this one? Second. Audio is off, too. Hot mic is off. Cool. So MBS—I don’t know if you know about this guy, but not controversial at all. Epstein claims he was friends with MBS and MBS claims he was not. Again, in this case I’m going to believe the dead guy because you see this pattern a lot. Obviously, MBS did not like that Epstein was claiming he was friends, but I don’t think he would have Epstein killed. I mean, MBS has never done that with anybody, according to him. People are laughing because MBS did allegedly—again, not according to him—have someone killed, a prize journalist in Saudi Arabia named Jamal Khashoggi. That’s the same last name as the guy Epstein worked with. Could that be a coincidence? How many Khashoggis do you know? Turns out Jamal Khashoggi was actually the nephew of Adnan Khashoggi. So Epstein worked with the uncle of the guy and then met MBS somewhere along the way. MBS claims he never met Epstein and then suddenly not only Epstein goes away, the journalist nephew of the guy Epstein worked with. I’m not making a connection here. I’m just stating obvious facts. All right, tape’s back on. So MBS is a great guy and that’s basically what I just said. Somebody might notice this tape has a missing minute, but I have great editors, so don’t you worry. Adobe Premiere. No, my editors use DaVinci, so it won’t look as smooth. After that, Epstein met this guy named Leslie Wexner, who is the CEO of Victoria’s Secret. Another red flag. Then Epstein started recruiting models even though he wasn’t in that—he was just a financier—but he would have parties at his house where he had Victoria’s Secret models. He was like the Harvey Weinstein of finance at this point. Jeffrey Epstein is probably worse than Harvey Weinstein. So he worked for Leslie Wexner, and this is where he made a lot of money. Leslie Wexner, if you don’t know, huge billionaire. During this time he became acquainted with Ghislaine Maxwell, whose father, Robert Maxwell, was allegedly a spy—allegedly Mossad. When he passed away she got his inheritance, and that’s when she started becoming friends with Epstein. Suddenly they both had a lot of money to pull together to do all sorts of crazy shit with the Clintons. Delete that part too. You’ve seen in a lot of pictures Epstein knew the Clintons, like both of them. The Clintons would never have anyone killed. Don’t look into it too much—the way he plays the saxophone is too sweet and innocent. All I’m saying is Epstein worked with a lot of people, so there are a lot of suspects. It ended up being like a game of Clue. A bunch of people wanted to kill this guy and they probably all double-booked, which is why they had to cut a whole two minutes and fifty-three seconds because they were like, “You’re here with the wrench, I’m here with the noose.” Come on. I think that’s what happened. I think they all just scheduled the same night because they knew that was the night and they knew the tapes probably reset for a minute. They thought they had a minute but ended up taking two minutes fifty-three seconds. So they had to use Adobe Premiere to finish the job. It was like three people arguing over who gets to kill him first, and that’s when Epstein snuck out and got choppered out by Mossad. But I’m just a conspiracy theorist. So now everybody wants to know the client list. But again, it’s on Wikipedia. You don’t need an official client list. Plus, he didn’t have clients; they were independent contractors. Nobody was getting W-2s. It was W-9s. Ask the IRS. They’re probably in on this too. You guys know the difference between a W-2 and a W-9. Jeffrey Epstein couldn’t tell the difference between a W-7 and 18. All right. Jeffrey Epstein purchased an island called Little St. James, which is also the nickname for his—yeah, I know a little grotesque, but you’ve seen the documentaries. That’s why we believe what the women are saying because they all had the same story. They said he had a house shaped like an egg. That’s even traumatizing for me because eggs are so expensive right now. The crazy thing is that many times Epstein got caught for what he was doing, but every time they let him off the hook because if you look it up on Wikipedia, every time Epstein got a case, somebody would show up in a suit and be like, “Let this guy go; he’s higher up than you.” This happened in the early 2000s when Epstein got busted in Florida, and the district attorney who was prosecuting him, Alexander Acosta, was going to give him a heavy sentence. Then somebody showed up and said, “He’s higher on the payroll than you,” so he had to give him a lenient sentence—a sweetheart deal. Alexander Acosta even says he planned a sentence but somebody told him Epstein was higher up, so he had to give a sweetheart deal. Years later Acosta became Secretary of Labor under Trump. Completely unrelated, of course. But something to know about that sweetheart deal is that they made a deal where anybody associated with Epstein at that time was cleared of guilt for the future—and Trump was associated with Epstein at that time. There was a case filed against both of them: a woman who said in the ’90s she was abused by both Epstein and Trump. She filed multiple times; there were witnesses and everything. Then the case suddenly disappeared around November 2016. I can’t put my finger on what happened around that time, but the case was dropped and the woman has since disappeared from the record that we know. So I think Trump killed him. I think Trump killed him. But again, we have to keep playing the game of Clue. Epstein was a creepy guy. He got massages like three times a day. For the sake of everybody involved we need justice. We need a happy ending. Little trivia about Epstein: he went gray very early but never used hair coloring product—lots of confidence, especially hanging out with younger folks. Some people get gray and feel they have to change their life—he didn’t. So you could say he never died. But here’s the thing. If Jeffrey Epstein is still alive, he would have to be somewhere that actively protects pedophiles. I can’t think of a region with that history—I’ll have to look into it more. As a detective, I’m talking about Israel, guys. I’m talking about Israel.

    "transcript":"In his stand-up How to Save Gaza, Sammy Obeid mixes absurd humor and political satire. He jokes about privilege, DoorDash mishaps, and a mistaken “leave inside” delivery that becomes a running gag about comfort and safety. Shifting from comedy to reflection, he acknowledges his Palestinian roots and anger over Gaza’s suffering, insisting his rage targets only politicians. Obeid imagines a darkly comic solution—sending politicians to Gaza disguised as Arabs, or mobilizing a billion people to DoorDash food there. Beneath the jokes lies a plea for empathy, creativity, and global awareness through laughter rather than despair. Premiered October 14, 2025 Sammy Obeid: How to save Gaza | Full transcript Good. Good. You guys are good clappers. Not really laughers, but I like it. Take your claps. Are you okay? You’re over there. I keep looking over. You look—you look very sad. You’re doing all right? Okay. It’s very awkward. Oh, it’s an awkward angle. Is that what it is? Oh, I keep looking at you and that makes it awkward. Yikes. So, you want me to not notice your depression? Like, it’s glaring at me. You’re right there. I mean, you have to understand, you know, I don’t expect you to be happy when I’m here. I mean, it’s nice. It’s nice to know that I show up, you know, across half the world and you’re like, “Yeah, this is cool,” you know, but even if you come to the show like this, you know, maybe I can help. But after five minutes of jokes and I look over still like this, I’m like, “I don’t fucking know what to do anymore. Maybe acknowledge it.” And then if I acknowledge it, like, why are you acknowledging it? Well, I don’t know what to do. I really don’t know what to do at this point. But if you’ve been following my stand-up for years, you know I don’t have one common thing. I just—I like to do difficult subjects such as triangles, or Palestine of course, these difficult subjects. And the reason I’m able to do these difficult subjects is because I’m very aware that I come from a place of privilege. Okay, I live in what’s called the first world. I didn’t—I didn’t know we were numbering them, but you know, I had a great childhood. Both my parents loved me. I was the favorite. You know, I grew up in apartheid, but on the good side, you know what I mean? So, I know what it’s like. And so, I’m aware. I approach difficult subjects coming from a place of privilege. I’m aware that I’m privileged because I thought about it this year. I thought about it very carefully. I thought about what was the biggest adversity that I’ve faced personally this year. And it’s very embarrassing. It was a night that I ordered DoorDash. I know this sounds horrible already. I’m aware. You guys know what DoorDash is. It’s a food delivery service. I like DoorDash because the people who bring you the food—they call them dashers. And so it’s like they’re dashing it towards you. Like, it just feels like they’re in a rush to deliver you the food like the king that you are. And so this night I was very hungry. So I ordered a burrito. I’m not sure if they have those in Australia yet, but it’s basically food wrapped inside of food. I ordered that for my tummy. And just a few minutes after ordering it, I thought, you know, I kind of want something sweet. So I’m going to order some ice cream. That’s—I’m living like the favorite child every day. You know, back in the day, I’d be like, “Mom, can I have ice cream?” She’d be like, “Yes, you’re the favorite.” And now I treat DoorDash the same way. I’m like, “DoorDash, can I get ice cream?” They’re like, “Yes, just send us more money.” And so, I ordered another order. I ordered ice cream. I don’t know if you’ve ever had the luxury of ordering two separate orders on one of these food apps. But two different individuals will bring you food from two different locations at statistically two different times. But on this very night, my two dashers arrived at the exact same time—and it was so embarrassing. Oh my god, it was so awkward. I was like, “Oh my god, they see each other. It’s so bad.” They clocked each other like, “You’re here for this guy? He wants that and this? Oh my god, what a pig. He’s probably going to eat with his hands too.” And they just set it on my doormat in disgust like, “Let’s get out of here.” And then I waited for them to leave, watching them through the curtain. Then I slithered out, got my two bags, and went inside. And I just ate them really quickly. Like, I punched them. That’s how I eat. Then that was the hardest night I had all year. That’s the level of privilege I’m coming from. Just letting you know. And okay. Well, there was a night where my house got broken into. Forgot about that one. Uh, and I know my house got broken into ‘cause I was inside, which I would argue is the worst time to be in your house. Some people are like, “That’s the best time because you can defend your home.” Like, that’s assuming that I’m a hero, which I am not. So, I was sitting on my couch one night, which is kind of near the front door, and I hear a knock. Now, when someone knocks on the front door, it can only mean one of two things. Either they’re trying to sell you something or kill you. Okay? And I was not interested in either of those things that night. Okay. So when somebody knocks on my door, my strategy is to just freeze… so that the person can’t even hear my motion. ‘Cause we’ve all knocked on someone’s door, rang the doorbell. You can tell when someone’s in there. You can just hear their aura. You’re like, “I know this motherfucker’s home.” So my thing is just like remove all traceable forms of life. Power down. Power down. And just wait for the knocking to stop. And they knock again. And I’m like, “This will pass.” Knock again. All right. Three knocks it is. Knock again. Getting greedy there, buddy. There’s a pause. I’m like, “Ah, they’re leaving.” And then they twist the doorknob. Oh no. They’re testing to see if the door’s open because nobody else lives here. So I’m just like, “Uh, hold on. Hold on. Don’t make any noise.” They twist it around again very aggressively. I’m like, “Oh, they really want to get inside.” Then it occurred to me, like, at what point am I going to defend my home? ‘Cause I—I really don’t think I’m going to. I really thought about it. I was like, if this person breaks into my house, I’m just going to pretend like I’m a statue. So if they come in, they’re like, “Well, that’s a real realistic-looking statue. Where’d he get it?” you know? Or they would know that it was me and they would see that I was scared so they would at least play along with the game. Like, “Whoa, that’s a cool statue. I’m going to go rob the place.” It’s like improv, you know? So, I’m like, “What am I going to do? What am I going to do?” Twist the doorknob. Then, this person starts throwing their body weight into the door. Don’t shake. Don’t shake. Motion. Motion. They do it again. And I’m actually really impressed because I can stand pretty still and I’m like trying not to shake or make any motion. I’m trying to stabilize. Stabilize. They do it again and then my phone goes ding. I was like—I looked at my phone and I kid you not, it actually was good timing because it just so happens 20 minutes prior I ordered DoorDash and my phone is notifying me that my Dasher was arriving and I was like, “Thank God, a hero.” I looked at my phone. His name was Muhammad, too. I was overjoyed. It said, “Muhammad has arrived.” I was like, “Peace be upon him.” I gave five stars right away. I was like, “You know what to do, buddy.” And then I see the GPS, the dot approaching the house. I’m like, “Mom’s going to save me. He’s going to save me.” He always does. And then I’m hearing this guy throwing his body weight against the door. I’m like, “Muhammad, do the right thing. Do it.” And then I see the dot approaching the door—throwing the body weight against the—and then I see him walking away. I’m like, “No, Muhammad, no. Where are you going?” He’s like, “This is not my business.” He’s like, “This is just weird.” And then I see him walking off further and I start to cry. Like, no. And then the guy throws the body weight against the door. Now I’m like freaking out again. And then I see the dot start to move back towards the door. I’m like, “Okay, he’s changed his mind.” He’s like, “I cannot stand for this injustice.” And my mind’s like making it political. I’m like, “Thank God for immigrants.” You know what I mean? Like, you know, good conscience, you know, doing the jobs that us citizens don’t want to do, like defend our own homes, right? So I’m like, “You go, Muhammad. Can I give him five stars again? I don’t know.” And then I see him approach the door. Guy’s still throwing the body weight. I’m like, “Muhammad, are you just watching?” And then he throws the body weight even harder this time. Like, “Muhammad, are you helping? Are you, like, throwing this guy against the door?” And he just bounces back like, “I’m helping this guy out.” I’m like, “What is going on?” And then it dawned on me. There’s a delay on this app. So, this has just been Muhammad the whole time. I look, I’m like, that’s his car right there. And that’s him. Oh my god. Why is my Dasher trying to break into my house? Like, was he like, “I’m going to leave this food. This house looks really nice. Might as well give a little, take a little.” My politics instantly changed. I’m like, “Immigrants—they were right!” You know, I’m like, “What do I do? What do I do?” And I’m like—now the adrenaline’s kicking. I’m like, “You got to do something. Do something. Do something. Save your home.” And I look a little closely and I’m like, “He looks kind of like a small guy. I could probably take him,” you know? So I open the door. I’m like, “Muhammad, what’s the deal, man?” And he looks at me. He’s like, “I’m so sorry. It says to leave inside.” Oh my god, this is so embarrassing. Oh my god, I put “leave inside” on the directions. That was a typo. I meant to put “leave outside” like a normal person, but I think maybe I made a typo and then autocorrect changed it to “inside.” You know, autocorrect. These are the kinds of struggles that I have. Autocorrect, really. And I kind of like took a moment to laugh at it. And I was like, “Man, I really appreciate you trying to get inside,” you know, because he’s like, you just had to leave inside. He has to follow the directions. I’m like, “That’s awesome, man. But, like, how far were you going to go?” You know, like, you nearly broke down the door. He’s like, “Yeah, my right side hurts.” I’m like, “You—I mean, definitely going to tip you for this one.” But like, I understand why he did that because, you know, these people who deliver food on the apps—I don’t know if anybody here does it—but like, you have to follow the directions because people get upset when you don’t follow the directions to a T. Like, you know, there’s been some Karen out there who’s like, “He didn’t leave it on the right corner of the doormat counterclockwise like I asked. One star.” So, now these dashers are traumatized. You know that somebody’s not going to get upset because they didn’t follow the directions. So Muhammad was like, “He said leave inside. I’m just going to get inside of his house by any means necessary.” They got to respect that hustle. So, you know, I gave him five stars again. Gave him a tip and sent him on his way. And then, um, and then I ate my burrito again. I went—I was like—and the burrito was so good I completely forgot to change the directions on my app. So, I totally just left it saying “leave inside” for another two weeks. And I didn’t realize this until two weeks later when I was back home again. And this night I was also very hungry. And so I ordered two dashers again. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. And the two dashers came at the same time again. I don’t know if it’s me. I’m just attracting like these two-for-one scenarios. But they came at the exact same time. And I didn’t realize it. And I didn’t realize that I hadn’t changed the app until I’m sitting on my couch and then I hear someone banging on the door and the window at the same time. These guys were trying to break into my house from two different entry ports. And I kind of just like looked out the window just to be like, “Oh, they’re doing a good job.” Like they even started working together like, “How are we going to get in this nice house? What are we going to do? Should we go around the back gate? You know, is there any—should I lift you on the roof? We can Santa Claus that down the chimney.” Like, they were working together. It was actually really cool, you know? But I had to go out there and break it. I’m like, “Sorry, guys. Muhammad. Muhammad. It was a complete mistake. Uh, thank you for the food. Peace be upon y’all. And uh, have a nice day.” And um, and after that I changed it back to “leave outside” and I’ve had no adversity since. So that’s where I’m at. I’m just letting you know so you know where I come from personally. Okay. And this is all just to say I’m aware that I don’t have a real struggle in my life. And that’s why it’s very easy for me to address obvious difficult topics and address people who are enduring real suffering because I know what real suffering looks like. I don’t know what it feels like, but I know what it looks like. I see people suffering in the world and I have to say something about it. A lot of you know I’m Palestinian, okay? People ask me like, “I see what you’re going through. I know you care so much about people in Palestine because you’re Palestinian.” To be honest, I don’t even think about being Palestinian when I see what they’re going through. I just see human suffering. That’s all it is. I just literally see—I don’t think that if I was any other race or nationality that I would see it any differently. I see people suffering. And I’ll be honest, for the last two years, I’ve been cycling between sadness, frustration, and pure rage. And I’m going to admit, at this point in time, I’m pretty locked into pure rage. I’m just in there. I make sure that my rage is never directed towards my fellow people around me who are trying also to be good people. My rage is not directed towards anyone other than my politicians. That’s it. And probably yours, too. My politicians and yours—I don’t know your politicians personally, but I imagine they’re all scumbags as well. And so I don’t even need to know their names and I hate them. Isn’t that beautiful? Isn’t that beautiful? Yes. But my hate is exclusively for politicians. That’s it. And now as a public figure, I can’t be up here advocating for violence against any politician. Y’all can do what you want, but I cannot be doing this. I need to be more creative about what I say. My bigger goal right now is I’m really trying to build my reach and my following so that I can get politicians to do my podcast because that’s how much of losers these politicians are. They’re like, “Oh, I bet I can do this podcast, get some votes.” That’s what I’m trying to do. My goal really is to get big enough to the point where I can invite my whole congress to my house. Okay? I’ll have to get a bigger house, but I’m going to invite them all over. Tell them it’s for content. We’ll order DoorDash. And then I’m going to tell them that we’re doing a makeover. So it’s makeover time. They’re like, “Yay.” Then I’m going to get a bunch of hair stylists and makeup artists and we’re going to put all of my politicians in what I call Arab face. Yeah. It’s a thing. I just made it up. But we’re going to give them Arab face. We’re going to give them a nice bronze brown. Put hair where it doesn’t belong. Put all the women in hijab like Zoran wants. I’m just kidding. But get them like indistinguishably Arab—you can’t even tell the difference between them and people in the Arab world. We’re getting them all arabbed up and we’re going to get them in an Arab plane. A plane, but it’s like they’re really Arab looking. And then we’re going to fly them out, air drop them directly into Gaza and watch them figure it out. Yep. And we’re going to call it Apac Island. Can’t you survive without your lunch money? It’ll be just like Love Island. You can vote them off at that point. I already got the poster. It’s just a picture of John Fetterman and AOC: “Is it a genocide now?” We got to get creative. It is the time to get creative because that’s pretty much all we have left. All of the basics that we’re doing are amazing. Speaking up, protesting, contacting your soulless politicians—these are all important things and we got to keep doing them, but we have to be doing something else on top. It has to be creative. It has to be something that nobody’s ever tried or thought of. I don’t claim to have the solution. I don’t claim to have the idea, but hopefully my idea will inspire. Here’s what I have right now. This solution requires a lot of people. We can’t just do this with a hundred people. We can’t do it with a thousand or ten thousand. We need like one billion people. If we can get one billion people to do something, I know we can end the genocide in Gaza tonight. One billion people. I know you’re like, “How are we going to coordinate with one billion people? I can’t even get my family of four to go to the same restaurant.” I know. So here’s my idea. If we can just get one billion people in the world to all at the same time agree to get on their phone and order DoorDash directly to Gaza and just put “leave inside.” These dashers will tear down the walls, crawl through the tunnels, parachute that food in, get their five stars, get fuck out. You’ll just see “Muhammad’s on the way. Muhammad’s on the way. Muhammad’s on the way.” And let’s face it, it’ll be good for the economy. Thank you so much. You guys are amazing. I love you.

    "transcript":"ComedianSammy Obeidopens his set pretending to “solve” the murder ofCharlie Kirk, half-detective, half-TikTok conspiracy theorist. He jokes about being scared to perform after the shooting, then thanks the FBI, Utah police, and the “Trump administration” before turning the applause into a bit about how the system lies. From there, he spirals delightfully through the “evidence”: a Gen Z shooter supposedly hiding a rifle in skinny jeans, a screwdriver mysteriously left on a roof, bullets engraved with memes, and a magic round that somehow stopped on Kirk’s titanium neck bone. He mocks every angle—AI photos, drones, professional fall guys, Cash Patel as the “dumbest Indian alive.” The theory keeps mutating: maybe Israel did it, maybe Trump, maybe Kirk’s oddly chill wife who’s now running his company. Then he ties it all to the 1998 Nicolas Cage movie Snake Eyes, which he swears predicted the crime—same name, same neck shot, same “Tyler.” By the end, the rant morphs into a weird kind of empathy: Obeid admits he never liked Kirk, yet now he’s the only guy trying to solve his murder. “You could say,” he deadpans, “I’m at a turning point.” Premiered October 3, 2025 Sammy Obeid: Solving Charlie Kirk’s Murder | Full transcript Rest now, brother, and I’ll see you in Valhalla. It was never my intention to make light of the murder. Charlie Kirk died on a biking accident. Okay, let’s get serious for a moment. A couple weeks ago, a man was shot in front of a live audience of people. In front of a lot of people. It was outdoors. Thank God comedy is indoors. Sorry, I was just thinking out loud. But a man was shot—shot dead. Fatally wounded, as they say. It’s kind of a misleading phrase. Like, “He was fatally wounded.” You’re like, “Wait, he was just wounded?” Like, fatally. Oh yeah, my grandfather reached fatal old age recently, actually. But I’m going to be honest with you. As a comedian, as a public performer, I was utterly scared. I’m going to be vulnerable with you guys. I was terrified when I saw that. I thought, wow, if that can happen to him, could it happen to me? I say some inflammatory things sometimes. I was just talking about Tylenol earlier. So, I was scared. I shut down. I freaked out. I honestly did not even want to leave the house. I felt like I had no one to talk to. I felt so alone and so in my head. But thankfully, within about 36 hours, the governor of Utah came out and said, “We got him.” And I finally relaxed and was like, “Thank God, we’re back. We are so back. Oh my God, they got the guy. They got the guy.” I want to give a special shout-out to the FBI, Utah police, the Trump administration, and of course, special shout-out toKash Patelfor bringing justice to this case. There was a killer on the loose for a little while, but they got him. Guys, why are you not excited? They got him! Yes! Have faith in the system. The system works. Okay? Yes! Just get back to work. Keep paying your taxes. It’ll go directly to Israel. It’s going to be totally fine, man. Yeah. Why are you not laughing, my love? All right, that was called satire. The truth is the killer is still on the loose and you should be fucking terrified and angry at these motherfuckers who are lying to you. They are lying through their teeth. And they’re doing it so deliberately and so sloppily, and people are back to work. And to be honest, I think it’s because so many people hated Charlie Kirk that they’re just like, “Nah, we’ll let this one slide.” Like, no, no, no, no. It doesn’t matter if you hated or loved the guy. Something happened here, and we deserve answers. We deserve answers. Unfortunately, you came to a comedy show where you will undoubtedly get more answers than from your government directly. Because unlike the government, I actually go on TikTok and consume information. I don’t just own and censor TikTok. I actually go on TikTok. And seriously, a lot of people don’t like hearing this, but this is very likely going to be the assassination of our lifetime. No, no, no. I’m sure a couple of you were alive for JFK—bless you, boomers. Bless you, boomers. Obviously JFK and MLK, these people meant more to a lot more people than Charlie Kirk did, but you have to understand these things were not shown to us live on social media. There weren’t millions of people watching when it happened, and there weren’t this many fucking people back in the ’60s. So this is actually huge, and it was done right in front of our eyes. And there are way too many holes in the story for us to just be like, “Everything’s fine.” You know, I think it’s so messed up that we are so desensitized to shootings that now whenever a shooting happens, every comedian’s like, “What’s my angle on this?” You know? It’s like the shooter already found it. I mean, structurally, a good joke—it’s about a 45° angle joke. And yeah, I make messed-up jokes, but my friends made way more messed-up jokes, because it was a school shooting and my friend called ita mass shooting. And I was like, “Bro, only one person got shot.” He’s like, “No, but he was Catholic.” I was like, “That’s fucked up, dude. That’s fucked up. It was a mass shooting.” I had to say it again, because I know half of you didn’t even get it. If you believe it’s Tyler, fine. You know, we all need someone to blame from time to time. And why not just put it on a guy named Tyler? That sounds perfectly reasonable.Tyler Robinson, too. Nice vanilla name. And I already told you, I’m against violence. I don’t have to repeat myself. I’m against violence. I don’t like that a guy got shot. I’m pro-humanity. I think it’s fucked up. But also, I’m going to make fucking jokes. Are you kidding me? It’s like people say, “Oh my God, you’re making jokes because a man died.” Have you seen my genocide material? Bro, stop shooting motherfuckers and I’ll stop making jokes. Deal? Maybe the jokes will get you to fucking stop doing it. Yeah. No, it won’t. But yeah, people are upset. Who cares? What matters isour government is lying to us. And sometimes you’ve got to be your own private detective. I really wanted to dig in, go into the case, watch as many TikToks as I possibly could. I wanted to look at the details and really understand why our government is lying to us and how to prove that they are lying to us. So let’s look at the facts here. Allegedly, Tyler showed up to the campus at 8:29 a.m. that morning, which—first thing to notice—not quite as much of an achiever as Luigi. Luigi was on site at 5:30 a.m. in the dead of winter. When the sun rises at 8:00 a.m., he was up with the birds, man. Tyler rolled out of bed at 7:45, grabbed his grandpa’s rifle, and then went to the school and allegedly stuffed it in his pants. Because you see camera footage of him walking around campus with no rifle, but yet he didn’t leave to go get it. So he was walking around with a rifle on him, and they don’t know where. So he had to have stuffed it in his pants—which I would believe if he wasn’t wearing skinny jeans. Bro, his Gen Z jeans were like this, and you’re telling me there was a shotgun right there, bro? I’m wearing relatively loose pants and I can’t even put my hand in them right now. This guy can put his whole grandpa’s rifle in there, bro? Bro, I don’t believe it. Okay, the shooting happened at 12:23 p.m., which is already really crazy, right? 12:23. 1-2-3. It’s like counting to three, but you stutter. Just saying—the signs are there, man. At 12:23, a shot rang out. Instantly, you have footage of allegedly Tyler running off the roof and jumping off the roof. Something you should know about this footage—it’s been alleged, there’s no actual proof of this, but I hope this does come out—that camera footage we’ve all seen of Tyler jumping off the roof is only a portion of what that camera shows. And that camera actually shows a wide view of the entire rooftop of that building, which could potentially show Tyler at the moment of the shooting. But for some reason, they’re not showing that. This is all alleged, but you would presume if we have a camera that caught him jumping off at the right time, why do we not have a camera showing more or less where he was on the roof at the time of the shooting? But you see him jumping off with no rifle. So either, again, it was in his pants, which—it wasn’t, because his knees bent, so there’s no way. And some people say they see a thingy—he has a thingy, perhaps like a towel or a piece of cloth—that the rifle is under, disassembled, which could potentially make sense. The only thing is, to disassemble it, he had to use a screwdriver, which he left on the roof. That’s what the FBI is saying. They say that the screwdriver—he left it on the roof. It’s probably still there. How sloppy they are—the screwdriver is probably still there. And they say that his DNA is all over the screwdriver. He just threw it on the roof like a fucking idiot. He’s like, “Disassemble!” So allegedly then he has the disassembled rifle. Fine, which I’ll buy that. But then he stashes it in the woods — or as he calls it in his text, his “drop site.” Okay. Stashes it in the woods fully reassembled, which is… okay. Don’t know why you did that. Does he like puzzles? You know what I mean? Sounds like his mom was taking Tylenol. Okay. He stashes it in the woods fully reassembled, which is fine. Maybe he did reassemble the rifle, but without the screwdriver. He left it on the roof. Did he have two screwdrivers? And he’s like, “This is my DNA one. This is my non-DNA one.” But he left the scope all messed up for some reason just to fuck with us a little bit. The crazy thing about this shotgun that he had too: it was allegedly his great-grandfather’s or his grandfather’s shotgun, which in his text he calls “my old man’s old man” or something like that. And get this — there’s no serial number on it. Why? Because it’s so old it was before serial numbers. Oh no. How convenient. Apparently, his great-grandfather used this rifle in World War I, then his grandfather used it again in World War II, and now Tyler used it to start World War III. Apparently, the shotgun, by the way, is called a .30-06. It’s existed for 119 years. Apparently, you can still use it. And it’s called a .30-06, which is also how old I tell people I am. I’m 30-odd-six. They can’t figure it out. They’re like, “Is he 37?” This .30-06, he stashes it in the woods, left his screwdriver on the roof for some reason after having it in his pants for half the day. It was a busy day. This started at 8:29 a.m. from this guy. Tyler then flees the scene and he goes home at some point — I don’t know if he goes home, but he goes somewhere — and he half changes his outfit. He only changes half. Doesn’t change the full outfit. Wants to leave us guessing a little bit. Changes half the outfit. And then he’s seen at 6:30 p.m. that night at a Dairy Queen — which again following in Luigi’s footsteps. What are you guys doing? Luigi went to McDonald’s. Tyler’s got to go to Dairy Queen. Like, Gen Z, do you really need fast food that bad? You just did a shooting. So there’s a picture of him standing at Dairy Queen, but there is a chance that that picture is AI, in which case… DQ. DQ. Okay. These are all just very surface-level, very easy to observe things. Here’s where it starts to get weird. There are engravings on the bullets — which again, is Luigi our guy now? Like, are we just doing everything like Luigi? If I ever had bullets, if I ever engraved bullets, it would be things about me, like “I’m late to things.” So like “delay,” “defer decimals.” That would be mine. There were engravings on the bullets. They were weird. Okay. But Tyler also — you know, you look at his story. He’s kind of a weird guy, I guess you could say. But one of them said, “If you’re reading this, you are gay. Looo.” Tyler is a 4.0 student. He literally had a scholarship. I don’t know. That just sounds like something more like Kash Patel would write, you know what I mean? Here’s where I think the most concrete evidence that this was completely staged and fake comes in. If you watch the video — and I know it’s gruesome — the video of Charlie Kirk getting shot in the neck. I know it was hard to see. For me, when I saw it I was like, “I can’t believe I’m seeing this.” I said that literally each of the 20 times that I watched it back-to-back. It was a lot. But there are a lot of videos now, both on the left, on the right, people from all over the spectrum who are analyzing this video. And they have a very good point. When you watch it in slow-mo, it does not look like the bullet is entering through here. It looks like it is exiting. In fact, when you see it very closely, you see some frames of something behind his neck and then you see— okay. Now, I’ve never been shot in the neck, so maybe it could go like this first. But I don’t think so. It looks like it’s leaving his neck and he kind of hunches forward, too, which is what you would do if you got shot in the back. And also that he does something with his hands. They say it’s like a neurological thing you do when you’re hit directly in the spine. He does that right away. So you would think it hits him there and then it comes out the neck. You literally see it coming out. When this shooting first happened, a bunch of people came out like, “Yo, this had to be a professional job because he did it from 200 yards.” But then a lot of hunters came out and were like, “Nah, I can do that.” So I’m like, “Fair enough. I don’t spend a lot of time at the range.” Okay. I’m kind of scared now, though. Fortunately, most of my shows don’t have 200 yards worth, but we’re good. But now all of the gun experts are coming out and saying a .30-06 will shoot through bricks. Oh, really? And they’ve actually posted videos showing the .30-06 shooting through like three bricks. But apparently the autopsy — which at first they said they didn’t do, and then two weeks later they said they did — claims that the bullet went into Charlie’s neck and his bones were so strong because his mom did not take Tylenol. She just drank straight milk. Straight antibiotic-rich milk. And his bones were so strong the bullet was stopped. A .30-06 — the bullet shot by a .30-06 which usually goes through cement — was stopped by Charlie Kirk’s bone. And they said he’s the man of steel. They said he’s the man of steel. Which — more like the man of stop-the-steal, if you remember 2020. But the bullet was literally stopped by the steel. Stop. Buy the steel. Now, this is utterly preposterous. If one thing has come from this whole Charlie Kirk thing, I realize I don’t believe in miracles anymore. The word “miracle” means nothing to me. The word “coincidence.” No. Like, you know what? You’re allowed one miracle a decade that I believe. And you’ve already used it. Biden stayed alive for his whole term. I am done with miracles. You’re telling me that this miraculous bullet came in from the roof over there and hit — it went in, made it look like it was leaving, went inside of him, and then was… and it probably on the way — on the way it like hit JFK, came back through, it like time-warped into the ’60s, came back around, and then punctures Charlie Kirk’s neck. It hits his bone and it’s like, “I’m done.” When every YouTube video using a .30-06 from any range shows it shooting through cement, but you’re telling me this magic bullet. Okay, it goes through. And you could argue, “You know, Sammy, it’s all an illusion. What happened was the bullet goes in and then it ricochets off and then turns around and comes back out.” You can argue that to me. You can make that argument because things do happen really fast. But in that case, you’re telling me this bullet goes inside and it does a… it’s like, “No, I’m going to turn around.” It does a complete 180 and then just goes the opposite direction. And that would literally make the bullet a turning point. Okay. I actually wrote that joke the first day, but I didn’t want to tell it till this week. I even told it to my comedian friend. I was like, “Bro, that’s brutal.” Like, nobody’s — once you look at that video, you’ll see like what the fuck is going on because you see the bullet coming from back here. Meaning that allegedly Tyler was on the roof over here, but like people who’ve looked at some, they see some weird blurs that are going on up there. They don’t know what they are. I’m not going to say exactly what shot Charlie Kirk. I’m not going to drone on about it, but I’m just saying look at the slow-mo replay we play of those videos. You see something very drone-like. And you also see like a mysterious aircraft flying away really quickly that could be like the mother ship for that drone. Crazy little fact here too. You know, this was at an event in Utah where the base was mostly conservative because they were there to see Charlie Kirk and support him. And then there was obviously a lot of liberals there who wanted to debate him. And then there were people protesting the event, and they say a lot of them were on the rooftops in the distance and they were holding up pride flags. And you can only imagine that if Charlie Kirk was shot and he looks up at who did it and the last thing he sees… it’s a rainbow of pride flag. It’s fucked up. But it’s obviously a joke because in order for that to happen, he’d have to think the shooter came from Tyler and we know he wasn’t. So you can relax. That’s not an insensitive joke. Just a hypothetical scenario. Watch the slow-mo replay and you’ll know the government’s lie. Okay. If that’s not enough — if this is the case — if Tyler did not shoot Charlie Kirk, then somebody else did, making Tyler a positioned fall guy. And you’re like, “But why would they go through all this effort to place a fall guy?” Well, we already have confirmed there’s already been two fall guys on the scene at that event. I don’t know if you saw after Charlie Kirk is shot, the very first thing that happens is an old guy gets up and he’s like, “It was me. It was me. Shoot me. Shoot me. It was me. It was me.” That’s weird. You don’t normally get that at shootings. This guy was very ready for that to happen. And so obviously they go for him, they grab him, they take him, they interrogate him, spend like a couple hours doing it, and just to find, yeah, it’s definitely not him. He even told the police, “I did that to let the killer get away.” He even told them that. That’s how crazy this guy is. Okay. Now it would be one weird thing if this was just a regular crazy guy who did the wrong thing at the wrong time. But it turns out this guy is a real person. His name is George Zinn. You can search him. And guess what? He was present at 9\/11. He was there in New York City at 9\/11. Guess what? He was also at the Boston Marathon bombing. I am not making this up. Google George Zinn. This guy apparently is the career fall guy. I don’t know what it pays — $50 an event — I don’t know what it is, but he’s out there working. He’s path-ing left and right. It’s a crazy list. It’s like 9\/11, Boston Marathon bombing, Coldplay, Kiss Cam — maybe not that one — but there are so many weird coincidences with this guy, George Zinn, who you would think would be someone to interrogate at this point. Like, “Why the fuck were you at 9\/11? Why the fuck were you at the Boston Marathon bombing? Why were you at my bar mitzvah last week?” All these weird occurrences. But you can’t interview him. Why? Because he’s now been busted for child porn. Yeah. So with all this going on, they then were like, “Let’s go on his laptop. Oh, here’s child porn.” And then they had to arrest him and now nobody can interview him. Yeah. And this — well, at least this is according to Kash Patel, who we should trust. And also according to Kash Patel, this child porn was not trafficked directly from Jeffrey Epstein. He was actually keeping it all to himself. And after they waste their time on him, they then find another guy who happened to be dressed identically as Tyler. And then they wasted a few more hours on that guy. And it was just such a coincidence — this guy dressed, looked just like Tyler the shooter on the same day that Tyler the shooter did a shooting. Sounds like a riddle, right? So there were already two for-sure fall guys. So why would Tyler not be the obvious third? Another thing was if you look at the videos of Charlie in his last moments, there are men behind him doing very weird hand signals. They’re going — either they’re like the world’s worst ASL interpreters or they’re potentially signaling like “it’s time to do it.” Some people actually interpreted the exact hand gestures and were like, “This means it’s time. Clear.” And then some were saying like, “Why would they even need to do that? They already had a clear shot.” And it’s like, “What do you know?” You know what I mean? Right. So all of these things are very weird. And honestly, after seeing all these things, I still — as a good person, as a naïve wanting to trust Uncle Sam — still believed, okay, there’s a potential that this is all true. It actually is Tyler. It’s just a very, very weird situation. Maybe the bullet ricocheted off the building and then went… I don’t know. Maybe that’s what happened. And so I was like, I’m willing to accept the government story that this was Tyler. And then they released the text messages and I was like, “Why are you doing this to us? Why are you doing this to yourselves?” Those text messages were… it was the most insane. I was like, “Am I tweaking right now? Am I on methamphetamines right now? Or did the government really release this text message conversation with the intent for us to believe it?” And if you haven’t seen it yet, do it on your own time. God, it’s not worth mine. I already put a whole YouTube video where I read them out loud to the crowd. They are insane. First of all, it’s all in complete sentences. Gen Z does not talk in complete sentences. In it, Tyler says things like, “My love” and “my vehicle.” Okay, Gen Z says, “My whip.” Everybody knows that. And it was so crazy and fake that it does make you think, okay, this is such a wild conversation that maybe this is how people speak in Utah. And maybe it’s so fake that it’s real. The government released it. Because why would they release something so glaringly fake unless it was like, “Yo bro, this is real.” In which case, my conclusion is whether it’s fake or not — which I definitely think it’s fake — whether it’s fake or not, the government did not read these texts before releasing them. Because any government in their right mind would read these like, “There’s no way people are going to believe this, dude. We should just keep these to ourselves and paraphrase.” But they didn’t. They just released it. They’re like, “Yeah, read it and weep.” And we’re like, “You are so dumb, dude.” And now I think we’re at the point where it doesn’t matter if you’re left, if you’re right, if you love Charlie, you hated him. If you believe the conspiracies or if you think it was just regular old Tyler, what all of America can agree on at this point and bring us together: we can all agree that Kash Patel is a fucking idiot. Okay, we can all agree this is unanimous. This is the one thing we should be united over. Kash Patel might be the biggest idiot in the world right now. Kash Patel, which sounds like a motel chain, is — he’s the head of the FBI. He’s Aziz Ansari’s jacked autistic cousin. He’s been doing such a botch job of this — not only this, but the Epstein files. And I’m not saying that Kash Patel is the dumbest person in the world. Clearly, he knows how to put on a suit. You know, he knows how to use big words like “Valhalla.” Okay? So I’m not saying he’s the dumbest person in the world. But I can say conclusively he’s the dumbest Indian person in the world. This confirmed. I can say this. I’m from Fremont, California. I know Indian people. And if that’s racist, I’ll fucking take it. But I don’t think there’s one Indian person in here who’s going to be like, “Yeah, he’s ours.” If I post this on YouTube, every Indian person is going to be like, “We don’t claim him.” That’s going to be the main comment. Okay. In Kash Patel’s defense, I do truly believe that he does not think that these are lies. He’s just being given the information and he really believes it. It’s really like just trying to watch a two-year-old child solve a murder. That’s what I would think if I was at that level of intelligence. Let me tell you, I do believe that Tyler was there. I do believe that he was there. And I do believe that in some shape or form, he either knew he was going to be the fall guy or he thought he was trained to think that he actually was the one who was going to take the shot. So I don’t know exactly who all did this with him, but let’s just say it was Tyler and all of his accomplices, if you will. Tyler and all. Tylerol. Tylenol. Tylenol. I think I might be autistic at this point. I actually think this whole case is making me autistic. So the question is if it wasn’t Tyler who masterminded this — if you are a gay operation — then who was it? Well, we can at least acknowledge that Netanyahu tweeted a little bit too quickly. When Charlie Kirk passed, it was really weird. He tagged, he said “Praying for Charlie Kirk.” He tagged Charlie Kirk for some reason. That was really weird. As if he knew Charlie Kirk was going to see it. Which, you know, there are conspiracies that Charlie Kirk is still alive. That’s the main one — that Netanyahu tagged him. He’s like, “Bro, huh? Get it?” Yeah. You see that? Charlie’s like, “Shut the fuck up, man.” It was weird. And then obviously a lot of people saw that and they’re like, “Oh, it was Netanyahu. It was Israel.” And so Netanyahu made not one but two videos. He’s like, “Now guys, Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. This is anti-Semitic.” They were like, “So shocking that you would say that.” So that’s obviously very suspicious. I mean, but it’s not crazy given the fact that Charlie Kirk was certainly a mouthpiece for Israel his entire career. And in the last year, he was slowly changing course. He was becoming more like Tucker Carlson who, you know — I don’t give a fuck what you say. I’m in love with him. Okay? I don’t give a fuck what you say. Do not show me old videos of things he said in the past. He’s doing God’s work right now and I’m in love with him and I don’t want you to ruin it for me. I love Tucker Carlson. When he laughs, I come. I love this man. I love him. And I love Candace Owens. And there’s nothing you can do to change that. Okay? Don’t push me away before I start having those feelings for Marjorie Taylor Greene. Okay? Don’t make me go that far. It’s crazy time though, dude. Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kim Jong-un. Um, so yeah, it’s a weird time, but yes, Charlie Kirk was slowly turning on Israel. So it’s not insane. Okay, now here’s the thing. Obviously I don’t think it’s fair to allege someone killed someone if they didn’t, but in the case of Israel, even if they didn’t kill Charlie Kirk, they still deserve the allegation anyway. You know what I mean? Like, first of all, the way he spoke about you killed his reputation with me, you know what I mean? And also, Israel, you’ve killed so many people without getting properly punished for it. You deserve an extra allegation. So what? You get off the hook for literally thousands of people and then you get one blame for someone you didn’t do? I’ll take it. And for the record, I actually don’t believe that Israel as a full entity conspired to kill Charlie Kirk. I don’t believe that. I believe they were definitely in on it somehow, but I don’t believe that it was like all of Israel was like, “Let’s get this guy.” I think it was a group of people who are somehow affiliated in some shape or form, but for legal reasons I have to be like, “Okay, Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. I’m a comedian. I’m joking. I don’t think that they have time for an assassination. They’re too busy with a genocide. Ask the UN.” Okay. And so, no, I’m not going to accuse them of this or any political assassination. I’m a comedian. I’m just kidding. Okay. And I have to say in that one because I’m just kidding. That’s JFK. Thought I heard a drone. Sorry. So anyways, obviously that’s suspicious. Now, I don’t think it was Israel. I don’t even really think it was Bibi Netanyahu. The first suspect, in my understanding, is Bill Aman. I don’t know if you know who Bill Aman is, but Zoran talks about him a lot, so you know he’s not great. Okay. Bill Aman is a billionaire in the United States. And I don’t know if I need to use a different name for his name if I’m gonna get in trouble for this, but let’s just say William Aman. I don’t know. He’s a billionaire, which already shows that he’s not a good person, right? If you’re a billionaire in this room and you’re offended, keep coming to my shows. You’ve got money. Here’s the reason why I say Bill Aman: because Bill Aman is very pro-Israel. He’s given money to the IDF. He’s been very heavily involved in Israel’s propaganda campaigns, and he knew Charlie Kirk very well, and a lot of people observed that Charlie Kirk was turning his words on Israel in the last year. So they started trying to reach—Netta offered Charlie Kirk $150 million to be more pro-Israel. Charlie Kirk turned it down and said no. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Turns out you like the guy, huh? Come on now. Come on. I love that. Libs growing, baby. I love that. But Bill Aman specifically — he staged an intervention for Charlie Kirk in the Hamptons a few months before Charlie Kirk was shot. A bunch of people were there. There’s witnesses. This has been confirmed. He staged an intervention where he tried to convince Charlie Kirk to be more pro-Israel. He’s like, “Just come on, man. Come on. You know, come join the boys again. Come on.” You know, it was a lot of that. Some people said the language was more aggressive — I don’t know if that’s the case. Some people said he made threats — I don’t know if that’s the case. But we know that he staged this intervention where he was trying to get Charlie to be more pro-Israel once again. Charlie again said no. ’Cause if you saw Charlie in his last few months, he was like, “I don’t understand what’s going on.” He called what’s going on in Gaza ethnic cleansing. He said, “Release the Epstein files.” He confirmed that Epste—probably was Mossad. He was pointing out the ills of the Israel lobby in the United States and their influence and how it doesn’t belong in our politics. And these are all things that I wholeheartedly agree with and, you know, it’s crazy that it took Charlie Kirk that long to turn, but he was turning. So Bill Aman begs, he stages intervention, he begs him, and Charlie Kirk says no. Couple months later, Charlie Kirk is shot by Tyler. So it’s unrelated, right? Now, if that’s not enough, this is the crazy part: Tyler was turned in by his dad. Okay, so that’s how you know this was a white family, right? Obviously. “Son, do you have something to confess to me?” “Dad, I shot someone at a school today. I’m so sorry.” Like, brown kids — we don’t talk to our parents. My parents don’t even know the names of my best friends, you know? But Tyler’s dad was like, “All right, where, when, what? Tell me who it was.” And Tyler’s dad then turned him in. But there’s a reason he turned him in that’s also not discussed as much, which is that there was a reward posted: whoever brings in the killer gets a reward — $1.2 million. That’s a pretty— yeah, I would have found Tyler for that one, right? And guess who posted that reward? Billing Aman, dude. Bill Aman offered the reward — $1.2 million. Now, some sources are trying to say, “Oh, but the father’s turning it down. He’s saying don’t— he’s donating it to charity.” Oh, boy. You can still Venmo it to him. You don’t have to be all public about it. But you don’t find that a little bit weird? A couple months earlier, this guy — this billionaire — is begging Charlie Kirk to turn and go with his agenda. Charlie Kirk says no. Couple months later, he’s shot. And then the next thing you know, the killer’s dad is paid $1.2 million. That’s fucking weird. That’s why I put that guy as suspect number one. Okay. Suspect number two: Trump. Those bruises don’t come too easily. All right? That guy’s clearly been handling a .30-06 of his own. Trump is so desperate at this point because, you know, so many people hate him and it’s so clear that he’s in the Epstein files — like we all know, even his base knows at this point. Trump is so good at lying that I think that he’s convinced himself that he’s true — no matter what. But I think that’s why he has these bruises now, ’cause his body is like, “Nah, dude.” It’s like, “We’re going to show the world what’s going on on the inside.” The bruises didn’t even come after the Epstein files. It wasn’t even that that got to him. I think it was theSouth Parkepisode. I think it was theSouth Parkepisode. It just hit him right here and the bruises started coming out. Charlie Kirk stormed into the White House and told Trump not to escalate with Iran. His words were starting to turn on Trump somewhat. And he was demanding the release of the Epstein files. Charlie Kirk has to understand he was the most influential and powerful conservative commentator, especially with the youth — which is their only hope for the future. And so, again, even if it wasn’t Trump, he deserves allegation. Him. He’s not getting punished for so many of his other allegations. Why not just throw another one in there? Okay. And you can’t remove me. I’m not on ABC. Okay, now back to the— so, suspect number three. This one’s going to upset a lot of people, but I wouldn’t be a true private investigator if I didn’t look into this option. I don’t know if you guys watch any of Erica Kirk’s speeches, but they’re a little weird. They’re a little weird, man. They’re a little weird, and I’ve been watching a lot of TikTok, and there are just some questions that I need answered. Okay, now I’m perfectly willing to acknowledge Erica Kirk — she’s the wife of Charlie Kirk — she may be completely innocent in all of this. I could be entirely wrong and a horrible person for even speculating, in which case I will burn in hell, in the flames of hell. I’m dead. The rapture. I’m dead. And she’s innocent. She’s an angel. She shall ascend to heaven. Great. Right. The Creator will settle the score. Okay. But in the meantime, shit’s looking a little weird, man. And I need some questions answered, bro. She’s given a few speeches now. Erica Kirk spoke at the Charlie Kirk Memorial, which I watched for research purposes. Okay. I’m going to be honest with you guys. I am a human being, and a human being who I disagreed with on a lot of things was taken from us on this planet. So I wanted to come at this from a human perspective. This man had a family. I wanted to watch this woman speak from a place of empathy and be like, “Yeah, I disagree with this guy on so many levels, but I want to watch this.” I came to cry, dude. I was like, “I need to cry today, man. The FBI is lying to me so hard. I need a safe place. I need to find solace in the eyes of this poor woman who actually lost another human being and remember the humanity of this. Remember that even if we disagree over politics, we are humans, and we need to connect with each other on the most subtle of human levels. So please, Erica Kirk, let me look into your eyes and let me weep with you while you grieve for your fallen husband.” And I came for that. I came to cry. But within 30 seconds, I was like, “What the fuck am I watching? What the fuck is this? Why is she laughing?” She was literally snickering. She was like, “I know he’s somewhere…” And I was like,is he alive? Tell us. Maybe she grieves fast. If she does, props to her. I’m all about efficiency. I could be that kind of sociopath. If I ever lose someone important, you might see me and be like, “This guy’s acting weird.” But I’ll tell you in advance: “Yo, I’m a weird person. I do move on very fast.” I lost a lot of math colleagues to Evans Hall and was forced to grieve very quickly—like a step function. So maybe she grieves fast. Maybe everybody’s different, and I could be totally wrong. And again, I’m going to burn in hell. I’m dead. I’m already dead. But while I’m still alive—why was she snickering during this performance? Why did she seem so chill about everything? Why has she now fully taken over Charlie’s company and is already doing podcasts? It hasn’t even been three weeks, and she’s already taken over the company, doing podcasts, smiling, snickering—and it just seems to me, from a very basic impression, that either Charlie Kirk is still alive, or she killed him. Those are the only two logical explanations in my mind. And again, you can be mad at me, but listen: when it comes to homicides, the spouse is always the first suspect. There are literally statistics that show that 60% of the time someone’s killed, it’s the person they’re in a relationship with. Sixty percent. In the world. In marriages in the United States, 34% of the time a wife dies, it’s the husband. One-third of the time if a wife dies, it’s the husband. And guess what—if a husband dies—yeah. Sorry, that’s you either scared for your life, or you just solved the murder. He’s like, “Oh, I’m so dead tonight, dude.” So according to stats: 34% of the time a wife dies, it’s the husband. I don’t know what the stats are for the gay community—it could be like 60, I don’t know. Thirty-four percent of the time a wife dies, it’s the husband. And when a husband dies, 6% of the time it’s the wife. Good job, ladies. Good job for being less. However, the stat says 6% of the time it’s the wife who killed the husband, but this is not including proxy murders—where the wife hired someone. Oh, convenient! That’s like most of them, dude. Rarely does she do it herself, let’s be honest. There’s no stat for that. Apparently—how convenient—there’s no stat for spousal proxy murders. But the global stat is if somebody dies who’s in a relationship, 60% of the time it has something to do with the person they’re in that relationship with. So can we at least not be curious about that stat? In this case—the biggest assassination of our lifetime, whether you like it or not. Now, I know some will say, “Oh my God, this is so cold, you’re analyzing a shooting by statistics.” Well, that’s kind of what Charlie did for a living. I don’t know if you noticed—anytime they talked about shootings, Charlie was like, “Well, 30% of the time it’s gang violence,” and you’ve got to factor that in. So I’m just saying Charlie’s up there being like, “Good man, you know.” Now, okay, that’s not all my evidence here. I didn’t know I had to prepare the case for you guys, but here’s my engravings. You can go down the rabbit hole yourself, but there are a lot of weird things about Erica Kirk. First of all, she knew President Trump before she knew Charlie Kirk. In fact, she won Trump’sMiss Arizonapageant. She worked indirectly with Trump before this. Both of her parents are involved in government operations. I believe her father was involved in Raytheon—directly in arms deals with Israel. Her mom worked for the Department of Defense. She’s literally born inside of the government. And she won Trump’s pageant. For a while, she was part of—or her family owned, or the people she worked with ran—an orphanage in Romania where a bunch of children went missing. So much so that some people say some of them ended up in Israel. I don’t know, maybe. I’m not going to spread that rumor without the information. But what has been allegedly confirmed is that she was involved with an orphanage in Romania where children went missing—so many that they had to shut down operations, and they are now banned from Romania. Do you know how fucked up you’ve got to be to be banned from Romania? Andrew Tate is mayor of Romania. To be banned from Romania, you’ve got to lose a lot of kids. And this was at a time when she was working with Trump, and also at a time when Jeffrey Epstein was still active. So do whatever you want with that. I’m just saying—that’s weird. She was born into a U.S. government family, worked with Trump, knew Trump—you saw that hug they had at the memorial. It was too weird. And she now owns Turning Point USA. Probably. We’ll see. If I’m wrong, burn me in hell. But she’s now taken over Turning Point USA. She’s already making content. And here’s what I find the craziest: when she met Charlie Kirk, it wasn’t on a dating app. It wasn’t at a bar. It was at a job interview. She went in to interview for a position at Turning Point USA—that’s how she met Charlie Kirk. She showed up for an interview, they hit it off, he fell in love immediately, and they got married in a matter of months. Wow. Yeah. And now she owns Turning Point USA. A couple of years later—they got married in 2021—barely four years later, she owns Turning Point USA. So, I’m saying, you can make all the connections you want, but if you look at the whole thing, it starts not with romance or love but with her applying for a job and ends with her getting a promotion. You can look at that however you want. I’m just pointing out coincidences—which I don’t believe in. I already told you that. The thing is, sometimes you need to take the red pill and go down the rabbit hole—because your government’s not going to do it for you, okay? The media’s not going to do it for you. ABC is still out there like, “Was Tyler into trans people?” You know what I mean? They’re still out there trying to figure out a fake story. Personally, I find all this absolutely absurd. I’m going crazy. Now, just to bring it back home—if you want some crazy, wild conspiracy stuff, this is the part that’s the craziest. This murder was apparently almost entirely predicted in a movie from 1998 calledSnake Eyeswith Nicolas Cage. Yeah. No, no—look at these TikToks. It’s insane. I’ll tell you. You’re not going to believe this either, so you’ll have to look it up yourself—but Wikipedia confirmed everything. A movie from 1998 calledSnake Eyeswith Nick Cage: the plot of the movie is a man named Charles Kirkland who’s murdered in front of a crowd of people. He’s shot in the neck—exactly like Charlie Kirk—at an event that was also a boxing match, where the boxer was named Tyler “The Executioner.” Even crazier—the date it happened in the movie was September 10th. You’re like, “There’s no way.” Look it up. Yes. Go look. It’s a movie calledSnake Eyes,on September 10th. A guy named Charles Kirkland gets shot in the neck at an event where the guy’s named Tyler “The Executioner.” And I’ll even add some more irony that you won’t find in these TikTok videos, something I discovered on my own: the movie was shot at Trump Tower. I’m not kidding you. It’s an inside job. We’re all stoned out of our minds. All our moms were taking Tylenol and weed and Molly and Percocet—it’s crazy. The movie is calledSnake Eyes.Snake eyes are when you roll two ones individually, right? What’s the probability of that? One over six times one over six—one over thirty-six. 30-odd-6. Which is also my age. I looked it up because I wanted to make sure I wasn’t completely gone. The edible had already kicked in, but I wanted to make sure it was me and not the edible. And I looked it up, and all of that stuff—the movie—it’s 100% there. It all happens in the movie. You can watch it. So I wanted to know—who kills the guy, Charles Kirkland? I looked that up. And this is how you know the movie’s from the ‘90s: the sniper was a Palestinian terrorist. God, I miss the ‘90s, man. Back when we actually had representation in movies. It wasn’t the good kind, but it was there. The guy who played him wasn’t even Palestinian, obviously. He was like a half-Latin guy. He was just like, “Hey, I’ll be your Palestinian terrorist.” And the Palestinian terrorist snipes Charles Kirkland because Charles Kirkland was working for the Pentagon on a big arms deal—selling weapons to Israel. That was the one detail in the movie where I was like, “Hmm, I think it’s—uh—” But even in that movie, it’s about Israel. Even in that movie, it’s about Israel! And the plot—sorry for the spoiler—but the plot is basically Nicolas Cage later finds out that his friend, who works for the government, was on the inside. He hired a Palestinian sniper who was willing to be the fall guy and basically jihad himself. But it was really his friend Kevin, who worked for the Pentagon, who was in on the whole thing and killed Charles Kirkland. So even in that movie—it’s an inside job. Wake the fuck up. Wake the fuck up. And really, this whole situation has taught me so much about myself and about humanity. Because I was not a fan of Charlie Kirk. I saw so many videos of him that made me go, “Why are you saying that, man? That’s so messed up. Why do you hate Muslims so much, dude?” Muslims believe in Jesus—they believe Jesus was a prophet. They’re so friendly with Christians. Why do you hate them so much? Why do you blame Black people for everything, man? Can’t you just be like, “These shootings are bad; we need to figure them out,” instead of, “Well, Black people need to take accountability”? Can’t you debate anybody older than fifteen, man? Come on. I really did hate this guy. I respected his chops as a debater; I just wished he used them on somebody his own age. So, yeah—I definitely did not like this guy. But after seeing this, and seeing how he was turning, I found my humanity. I found my appreciation even for people I completely disagree with—because nobody deserves that. Nobody. Not only does nobody deserve to be murdered—but nobody deserves to be murdered and lied about. You know what I’m saying? And I know nobody agrees with me because you’re in San Francisco—I get it—but I found my own humanity. This whole time, I really hated Charlie Kirk and all the things he said. But now I’m one of the only people trying to solve his murder. You know what I mean? So I’m trying, dude. I’m trying, man. You could say I’m at a turning point.

    "transcript":"Sarah Silverman: PostMortem (2025) [in deep voice] This is the lowest my voice goes. [in normal voice] Oh my gosh, Ali Wong. Jerry. My parents? [male announcer] Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between. It’s time to introduce my former lover. Yeah, that makes more sense. Oops, how did that slip out? Please put your hands together for your pal and mine, Sarah Silverman. [audience cheering, whistling] [audience cheering, whistling] Wow. Uh, wow! I accept. If this doesn’t bookend with that, it’s… it will be a failure. But… I’m concerned you’re setting yourselves up for disappointment. But I’m so happy that you’re here, and I’m so happy to be here in New York City… [audience applauding, whooping] Ah! …at the Beacon Theatre. And I… This is actually the middle of my tour. And, uh, I’ve come to really love being on the road, especially now. You know, just, one, because I really love connecting with audiences, you know, now more than ever. And, two, because I’ve really become a, a… a real hotel slut. I, um… I just love when a hotel is really nice. You know how… You know how you can tell if a hotel is fancy? If you come back to your room and where you left off in your toilet paper has been folded in a perfect triangle. I mean, there’s just, I mean, nothing more luxurious than, um, knowing that a stranger’s fingers… …have handled something that you will press to your asshole at some point for sure. Mm! It really is how the other half lives. And, um… I’ve been with my boyfriend… [hesitates] …Rory, for five years. I should be able to say his name better, but it’s ridiculous. [stilted] Rory. Rory. But, you know, it’s enough time that we do things to jazz things up a little. Like, uh, lately I’ve taken to jerking him off with my non-dominant hand. Which is great, you know, ’cause it feels like someone else is doing it. And, uh… I was actually a little bit proud of myself when I thought of that joke. And Rory was sleeping next to me, and I woke him up and told it to him. He goes, “Yeah, that’s good. You know what we call that?” [audience members] The Stranger. Everybody knows but me. I had never heard that before. And, you know, it’s just crazy because I always feel like, um, women, in general, are more familiar with, uh, the experience of a man. We need to see the world through a male lens in order to just survive. Men don’t need to do that, but, um… Yeah, this one got by me. “The Stranger.” I love it. He goes, “Yeah, like, uh, I’ll use my left hand, or sometimes I… I’ll sit on my hand to numb it up a little.” I mean, swoon. And, well, I think this is normal, like… We’ll do things with sex, like we’ll start talking fantasy talk sometimes during sex, like… One time, we were fooling around, and this just came out of my mouth. I-I didn’t plan it. And I go, “You just showed up at my summer camp.” And even he was like… [disgusted groan] [chuckles] But he saved it. He goes, uh, “But you, like, own the camp, right?” I go, “Yeah. Yes.” “I own the camp. Yes.” Uh, oh, another time, I was on top of him… What, do I go side to side? I… Whatever. The position doesn’t even matter, but we were doing it. And then he goes, he’s like, “This is so crazy. Like, I don’t even know your last name.” And, you know, I’m playing along, and I said, um, “It’s Hitler.” He came immediately, which was… [audience applauding] …a little disconcerting. Right here. Right between my… [audience laughing, applauding] …my upper lip and my nose bottom. Oh, my dad and my stepmom Janice both died last May, nine days apart. And… Oh, that one needs work. But they really did, and, uh, I was really close with both of them. And my dad was my best friend, and, uh, they both gave me so much. And most recently, about an hour of new material, so let’s do this. [audience whooping, applauding] Good. [audience cheering] All right, uh… Let me introduce the characters involved. Uh, first, my dad, Donald “Schleppy” Silverman. Everybody called him Schleppy. Uh… Born in Boston, then his family moved to… [audience members cheering] You’re like, “I’m from Boston.” You’re from Quincy. But, uh… [chuckles] Uh, they moved to New Hampshire, and that’s where I was born and raised. And, uh, my dad owned a discount women’s clothing store called Crazy Sophie’s Factory Outlet. It’s funny. When I tell people I’m from New Hampshire, they’ll go, “There are Jews in New Hampshire?” Then I have to explain to them that, you know, even New Hampshire deserves retail. And, uh… He’d do his own radio ads. He’d be like, “I’m Crazy Donny.” “When I see the prices at the mall, I just wanna vomit!” And then he’d rattle off a bunch of off-brand brands. And then at the end, he’d go, “If you care enough to buy the very best, but you’re too cheap, come to Crazy Sophie’s!” It… You know, I think he named it because… Um, Crazy Sophie’s Factory Outlet. He… He loved Crazy Eddie from New York, you know, in the ’80s? And he wanted to do something like that. [audience whooping] And, uh… But he needed it to be a woman’s name ’cause it’s women’s discount clothes. And then, you know, we’re Jewish, so he wanted to sneak in a Jewish-y name, so he picked Sophie, Crazy Sophie’s Factory Outlet. And my nana, his mom, was very upset because her best friend back in Boston was Sophie Moskowitz. And she felt that he was calling her crazy. And, uh, he explained to her, “Mom, if I named the store after Sophie Moskowitz, I’d call it Ugly Sophie’s Factory Outlet.” And I thought that story was so funny, so years ago, I told it on a talk show, and I didn’t realize at the time that, um, Sophie Moskowitz was still with us. And, um… It caused much tsuris between the families. But I… I did make absolute sure, um, that she’s dead now, so… My dad, uh, he called me every Saturday, and I almost never picked up the phone because his messages were gold. And I committed a couple of them to memory. I remember one was around the time when everybody had cell phones, like, even in New Hampshire, you know? And he calls me, and he goes, “Guess where I am?” “The car wash. Can you believe it?” “I’m talking into this hunk of plastic, and it’s bouncing off the sky and down to you.” The sky. Yeah. And then he just starts going, “Oy.” “Oy!” “Oy!” His windows were down. And I was listening to him get soaked for several minutes. That is a very specific oy from my dad. I haven’t heard it a lot. Um… We went to exactly one movie together, uh, when I was younger. Um… It seemed like the perfect movie by the title, but it really wasn’t. It was called Boys Don’t Cry. Brilliant film, but don’t go see it with your dad. And, uh… There’s an absolutely brutal sexual assault scene. And during it, the entire theater is silent, and all you can hear is, “Oy.” “Oy!” The other message I committed to memory was, uh… [laughs softly] I had… I had moved to Los Angeles, and I was getting jobs, like, on TV shows and stuff. And, uh, he calls me up, and he goes, “I know you’re a real Hollywood hotshot now.” “Maybe you could find time in your busy schedule to call back the guy who gave you life.” And then it sounds like he’s hanging up, but he gets, like, a new idea and he goes, “I used to lift up your little legs and wipe the shit out of your tuchus.” “Maybe you can find a minute for me.” He… He really loved getting old. He loved it. He, he, he knew he was adorable. He loved what he could get away with. We were at a sandwich shop in LA. And we’re eating, and these two huge muscle guys walk over to him and start, like, threatening him, like… [grunts] And he’s laughing, and they leave, and I’m like, “What was that?” He goes, “Oh, I went to refill my Coke, and then I saw those two big muscle guys.” “So I walked over there, and I go, ‘You know what?'” “I feel like kicking some ass.” With his little nubby elbows. He had sacks of water that just hung off of both of his elbows. Uh, you know, even the doctor goes, “I can drain those.” He said, “Nah, my grandkids like it.” Oh, I was home. Uh, I took a quick break from tour to go home for the holidays. And, uh, at that time, I, um, went and got my teeth cleaned because, of course, death creeps in through the gums. And, uh, my dad and I had the same dentist, uh, Dr. Hernandez, so it was fun to see him. And he’s cleaning my teeth, and he goes, “I miss your dad!” And I go, “I know, I miss him too.” And he goes, “No, you don’t understand. You have to look at my Yelp page.” So this is a little addition on this half of the tour. Oh, fuck, I don’t have, um… I’m not wearing my glasses ’cause I’m shooting a special. Somebody throw me some readers. Uh… Just one of you. Some of you. Uh… You know, don’t panic. Um… Just chuck ’em right up on stage. Readers don’t have, like, a specific… Okay! [audience applauding] [audience whooping] Was that you? Ooh. What do you clean these with, salami? All right. I’m kidding. Be grateful. I appreciate you. This is my dad’s Yelp review. “Five stars.” “My dentist theory is, if it doesn’t hurt, don’t fix it.” “At 84, this has worked pretty good for me.” “Now, I finally find an exception to my rule.” “And that exception is James Hernandez.” “No time is wasted with Jimmy at the helm.” “He has golden hands, fixing what ails your mouth promptly and efficiently.” “Get rid of your old shit dentist, and switch to the best.” “Tell him Schleppy sent you.” [audience laughing, cheering] [audience applauding] Oh my God. So funny. Uh, he called himself a reverse snob, which I tried to explain to him is really just a snob, you know, and, uh… But he hated rich people. And they would go to Florida in the winters for a while ’cause Jewish law, and… He would, uh… He’d sit at the Starbucks and heckle people. He’s sitting there, and a guy in a Bentley pulls into one of the spots. And my dad stands at the head of it and starts going… “Good for you!” “Good for you. You got yourself a Bentley.” “That could probably feed 100,000 people in Africa.” “But you need a Bentley. Good for you.” My stepmother, she’s like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “Your father’s been punched in the face three winters in a row.” Like, if he saw anyone with a Rolex, he’d be like, “Oh, nice Rolex.” “My Timex was 30 bucks, and I can swim in it, but good for you.” “You need a Rolex. Now everybody knows you’re rich.” [chuckles] He really fucking hated rich people until I started making money. Then he was like, “I’m never flying coach again.” Uh, next, my mother, my biological mother, Beth Ann O’Hara. And I know some of you are… Your wheels are spinning. She married an Irish Catholic man. She’s fully Jewish. You can still jerk off to me. [audience laughing, applauding] Beth Ann died eight years ago. And, um… Let me describe her. She was… She was just a natural beauty, no makeup. She wore, like, overalls with paint all over them ’cause she’d paint in them, and, um, like, two different color socks. And, uh, she had a jewelry box, but it was filled with, like, political pins. And like, you know, no bra, nipples out ’cause fuck the man. And then, in contrast to that, her personality was… She… I don’t… This isn’t an original way to describe her, but she really was exactly Diane Chambers from Cheers. Like, she really said, like… [enunciates] …when and where, and… you know, grammar and diction and enunciation were her passions. We… l remember being with her as a kid. We were ordering food. And she goes, um, “I’ll have the breakfast croissant.” And, you know, we live in Manchester, New Hampshire. They say “avocaydo” there. I… I’m like, “Mom…” The girl’s like, “The what?” “The croissant, the breakfast croissant.” I’m like, “Mom, it’s a Croissan’wich.” “We’re at Burger King. Like, meet people where they’re at.” She, um… She was a director. She directed local theater in Manchester, New Hampshire. And she was a born director. You know, little notes, little corrections for everyone she met. Never met a comment card she didn’t fill out. She was actually the voice of our local movie theater, uh, Bedford Mall Cinemas. Um, “Where all bargain matinees are only two dollars Monday through Saturday.” And she got the job, um, because she complained. She went right in and said, “I called to see what movies were playing, and the man on the line was indecipherable.” “He had no diction. I couldn’t understand a word he was saying.” They were like, “You wanna do it?” She was like, “I… [chuckles] Well, I don’t know. I…” “Yes!” “Yes! Okay!” And, uh, a star was born. She really never lied. It would never occur to her to lie, even to, like, protect someone’s feelings. She just… She just didn’t do it, you know? Like, uh… She was directing a play, and, and one of her young actresses asked her, you know, “Beth Ann, do you think I could really make it someday?” And she said, “No!” The only reason I know that story was I was asking my sister Susie if she had any stories about Mom, and she told that to me, and I said, “How do you know that? Were you there?” And she said, “No.” “Mom told me ’cause she couldn’t figure out why that girl was crying.” That girl… Pam Sullivan. Right. You’ve never heard of her, right? Not talented. Did not have it. But, you know, she was my mom. I… You know, I sat with her as she was dying. And I was holding her hand, and it was a quiet moment. And it was the last thing she said to me, and she looked up, and she said, “Your hair.” [whispers] “It’s so dry.” I really wouldn’t change it for the world, you know? I know it sounds like I’m being hard on her, but honestly, I’m so grateful. She always told me the truth, and it was a bummer a lot of the time. But sometimes it was something nice, and then I knew it was true, you know? I mean, I think we need more Beth Anns in the world, you know? Uh, if we’re lacking anything in this world right now, it’s… it’s truth, you know? [audience whooping, whistling] The cold, hard, braless nipples of truth. [audience applauding] Enter Janice, my wicked stepmother, um, as she called herself. She was just the sweetest lady you could ever meet. Um… Just to give you a, um… idea. Like, bleach-blonde hair. Face full of makeup. Nails that match the shoes. A whole outfit. She had a style. Very different from my mother. Um… And so sweet. And one time, she picked me up after work, and I got in the car, and she said, “What do you think of my makeup?” And, uh, because I am my mother’s daughter… …I did have several notes. But because I was also Janice’s daughter, I did know to shut the fuck up and tell her it was beautiful. And honestly, thank God I did, um, because then she said, “It’s tattooed!” Janice was very literal. What do I mean by that? I don’t even know, but she, she needed, like, specific instructions, you know? She wasn’t dumb. She was literal. She needed… She was very good at sports, for instance, ’cause she could learn each step. You know, like… You know how, like, I put my hair in a ponytail? It’s just like… [babbling] You know? I feel like she’d be like, “You pull the hair through, and then you twist.” “Then you put the hair through that.” You know what I mean? She’s very step-by… You know how you scramble an egg? You just gotta kinda have a feel for it. I feel like Janice would be like, “You put the fork in, and then you put it in a hundred little circles.” I was in the car with her, and, uh, I go, “Janice, do you have any ChapStick?” And she looks, and she goes, [tuts] “Oh, shit.” “Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry, I don’t.” And I go, “It’s okay.” And then, like, a moment later, she goes, “I have something called Vaseline Lip Therapy.” “Yeah, that’s great. I…” “You know I’m not sponsored by ChapStick, right?” [chuckles] Uh, my sister Laura is just an all-around artist. She does everything, and she had painted something, and she thought, “Oh, Janice would like this.” So she mailed it to her, and then Janice got it. And she called Laura, and she goes, “How did you know?” And Laura goes, “Know what?” And she goes, “It’s all my colors.” “Tan, bronze, and animal print.” This woman. You know, I’ve been doing stand-up since I was 17. And when I think back at my younger years, at how absolutely cunty and judgmental I was, I’m so embarrassed. Like, I remember thinking, like, “Ugh. Women in leopard print is so lame.” Like, “It’s so tacky.” “Only old Jewish and Italian women wear leopard print.” And then I turned 50, and I realized, you know, it’s such a fun print. Um… [scattered applause, whooping] So as Dad and Janice got older, when they would have doctor’s appointments, we would have them record on their iPhone, you know, on the voice memo app. And then they would post that on our family WhatsApp chain so we could listen to it and make sure everything was being taken care of. And… The Silverman family is so up each other’s assholes with WhatsApp chains, by the way. We, uh… We’ve got, like, Silverman United, like, everyone WhatsApp chain. And then there’s four sisters, so then we have the, like, the sisters chain with us. And then, um, like, all the sisters minus one and all the different combinations. So Janice has this doctor’s appointment, and we know it’s gonna be bad news. We know it’s… We’re pretty sure it’s gonna be very bad news. And we have them record, and, uh… they post it on WhatsApp. And we’re listening back, and you hear the doctor say, “Janice, I’m so sorry to tell you this.” “But you have stage-four pancreatic…” And then all of a sudden, you just hear this very loud, low, rolling fart. And it’s… it’s, like, three seconds. And I know people say three seconds to denote, like, a quick amount of time. But if you really think about it, like, with Mississippis, it’s lengthy, you know? And I… I know it’s my dad. You’re probably like, “Oh yeah, I bet Schleppy farted all the time.” I… I’ve never heard him fart in my life. I just… I know that he did not have the tools to handle this, and so his body took over. And now I’m sitting there going, “Stage-four pancreatic what?” But I used context clues. Their individual reactions to this news… I’m still listening, you know, and Janice is just… Her reaction is so Janice, you know? She just goes, “Well, I’ll just do everything you tell me.” “And I’ll… I’ll just do every single thing you say, and I’ll… I’ll fight it.” And… like, it was just so her. And then my dad’s reaction was the craziest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life. I’m not kidding. You just hear him go, “I’m alone!” Then he goes, “I’m a widow!” I know my mother, Beth Ann, is out there somewhere going, “It’s widower,” and… But, Mom… Um… It was so crazy. Uh… I… I’m the designated dad whisperer, and I was tasked with calling him. And I had to say, “Dad, you cannot talk that way in front of your alive wife.” “You have to pull your shit together, okay?” “This isn’t about you.” “This is about Janice. You have to take care of Janice.” “You have to focus. You can’t, like, fall down right now.” And he said, “I know, I know.” And then he started sobbing. And I’ve really never heard him do that, you know? And he goes, “I just… I don’t wanna be in a world without my Janice.” “I just don’t wanna be here without her.” And I just… I wanted to console him, and I looked for something to say, and I said, “Well, you know, statistically, you won’t.” And… I mean… I didn’t know that was gonna come true. I… Obviously, this is not a time to say, “I told you so,” or anything. I… But we got off the phone. He promised he was gonna take care of Janice. And the next day, I did talk to Janice, and she said that she asked him for a glass of water. And he said, “Where is it?” “Where is water?” It’s in your elbows, Dad. [audience applauding] [Sarah chuckles] Find yourself a Capri Sun straw, and pop it in there. She’ll go to town. [audience applauding, whooping] So, needless to say, uh, the four sisters and the few grandkids descended on to their apartment. And we kinda… We doula-ed them through death. And death is… is… It’s really hard for me. And that’s what makes me unique. And, uh… No, I… I know it’s not. But it is. It’s hard for me. It’s very hard for me to even, like, kill a small bug, and, you know, almost impossible to make it look like a suicide. I, um… They’re so little. We had flies… We had flies in the house, a lot of flies, and I won’t… I don’t wanna kill anything, and I just… I opened the door and was just kinda, like, air traffic controlling them, like, “Go! Pssh!” But in their defense, you know, I realize they are houseflies. They were in their natural habitat, so I let it go. But then, um, there were too many flies up in our bedroom, and it was too much, and I… I didn’t like it. [hesitates] I didn’t like it at all. And Rory was like, um… “Do…” Ror… I can say it if I say it fancy. [in posh voice] Rory. Rory. Rory was like, uh, “Uh, you want me to get rid of them?” And I said, “What do you mean get rid of them?” He said, “Do you want them gone?” I said, “Okay.” And I went outside the room, and I shut the door, but I… I stayed, and I listened. And all of a sudden, I heard, like, smash! Smack! Bam! And I was like… [squeals] And he must have heard me go… [squeals] And, uh, then he got quiet. And then I heard him open the window, and then he goes, “Bye, guys!” “Fly safe!” I know. And I know he did that for me, you know? I mean, I know he murdered them, but he lied for me, you know? I think I… The reason why I have such an affinity for flies… Oh my God, we’re still talking about flies? Yes. I do have about four more minutes on flies. [clears throat] But, like, a million years ago, I learned this fun fact that, um, flies, they only live for 24 hours. Like, that’s their whole lifespan. And I don’t know, there’s something about that that’s so, uh, beautiful and heartbreaking and poetic, you know, like, a whole lifetime in a day. And, uh, I don’t know, I just think it’s so… You know, this is when I actually first learned this. I was a writer\/feature performer on Saturday Night Live. [audience cheering, applauding] Thank you. I… I made an indelible impact. And, uh, it was, uh, the 1993-94 season, just to give you an idea of how good I look, and… I had just learned that fun fact, and it was Phil Hartman’s last year. And… Not of life, but… …at the show. He went on, and he did that, uh, NewsRadio, you know? And, uh, he was so nice, and he said, he goes, “Hey, why don’t you write a sketch for us to do together?” And I was like, “Okay.” And I wrote a sketch, and it was about flies. You know, like, it… it starts with, uh, one of those, like, Star Wars crawls that explains it. “The average fly lives 24 hours.” Blah, blah, blah. And then he played, like, an elderly fly on his deathbed, like, twenty-three and a half hours old. And I’m, like, a young fly, just sprouted wings, and he’s telling me the ways of the world, like, you know, “I remember noon,” or whatever. And, uh… [chuckles] And then, I don’t remember it, but at the end, like, a dog comes and takes a shit and then leaves. And then he says something to me like, “Go get it, kid.” And, uh… You’re not gonna believe this. It didn’t make the air. But, uh… I just, like… I think flies are just so cute. And I don’t understand why we kill them. I mean, we love animals when they’re small. And then they get too small, and you’re like, “Kill them.” You’re monsters. They’re so little, you know, with their, like, their little wings and their giant eyes, and they’ve got their hands going like they’re hatching a plan, you know? Like, I was brushing my teeth, and there he was, a little baby fly, just sprouted wings. And I was like, “Welcome to the world, buddy. You’re gonna have such an adventure.” And then, um, that night, I was washing my face, and there he was. He was all grizzled and old and, like, wasn’t even… He wasn’t flying anymore. He would just take, like, a stilted half-step now and then. And I said, “You did it, man.” “What a ride.” And Rory was in the bathroom. And he said, “I don’t think that’s the same fly.” I… I think it’s just this moment in time, in our world, in our country. I just… I don’t want a man to tell me anything. Not… Just not… And not anything at all. And it… it’s not right… [audience whooping] …but this is how I feel. I said, “It’s the same fly, but thank you.” Then he has the fucking lips to go, “Are you sure flies only live 24 hours?” I’m like… [scoffs] “You know what? Maybe you should look it up.” “Because what do I know? I’m just a girl. I probably dreamt it.” And he did back down, and he’s like, “Okay, okay.” But, um… I did end up looking it up, and they live about a month, but, um… I don’t know. You know… [audience laughing, applauding] I don’t give a fuck! No. So Janice went first. Four months to the day. She loved life– Was that too fast a turn? She loved life so much. She wanted to live, you know? She did everything right. And it just sucked, and… And this seems like a good time to mention, um, I do have merch this tour. How fun is that? You know, I’ve never really had merch before. You know, we got Schleppy hats and Postmortem T-shirts, and, like, big, gray, like, collegiate sweatshirts that say Silverman. It makes me feel like I went to college, and, uh… You know, I… I never really had merch before, but I just really feel like my parents would want me to monetize this. [audience applauding] [audience cheering] Thank you. So, uh, like I said, Janice went first, and we knew it was coming. And, uh, I had actually gone home that night to sleep. And I got a text from my sister Susie, who’s a rabbi, around 7:00 a.m. And she said, uh… She said, “Janice passed away around 2:00 a.m.” “And she’s still here, and Dad is sleeping.” “They’re holding hands.” They were holding hands. And she said, “You know, normally, Dad would be up, but I think he, in his bones, you know, he… he knows, and he just doesn’t wanna face it.” “Um, but I’m here, I’m sitting right next to him, and I’ll be here when he wakes up.” And I said, “Okay, great.” And then all of a sudden, she remembers this joke that she and my dad always loved. And the joke is something like, uh, a brother calls his brother, and he goes, uh, “The cat died.” And then the brother goes, “Don’t just call and say the cat died.” He goes, “What do you want me to say?” He goes, “Call and say the cat’s on the roof, and we can’t get her down.” “Then call and say, ‘We’re at the vet. It’s not looking good.'” “Then call and say, ‘The cat died.'” And the brother says, “Okay, I’m sorry.” And his brother goes, “It’s all right. How’s Mom?” And… You’re ahead of it. [chuckles] He says, “She’s on the roof, and we can’t get her down.” [audience laughing, applauding] So now Rabbi Susie remembers this all in one minute, and she just… she’s hysterically laughing. And she is a rabbi, but when she starts, she can’t stop. And it’s loud, and tears are running down her face. And she just can’t stop. And she’s now terrified that Dad is gonna wake up and be like, “What’s so funny?” And she’d be like, “Janice died.” And she texts me, and she goes, “When he wakes up, should I say that Janice is on the roof, and we can’t get her down?” And I’m like, “Yes!” Because we are a very dark, fucked-up family, but I… I did think better of it, and I said, “No, be a rabbi.” “And later in the day, uh, I’ll tell him.” But it’s so funny. We’re… We’re only just grieving, like, now, you know, because it took… There’s just so much logistics. You don’t expect it. It’s not how it is, like, in the movies or something. It’s just… There’s so much to do, and I… I feel bad saying this. They were such responsible people, but the craziest thing is they made no death plan. And so we were left with so much to do. And I… I don’t want to blame… I mean, listen, in their defense, they were only 80 and 85. Who knew? And I guess I basically knew what they wanted. Like, my dad always said, “Throw me in a pine box and bury me.” “I’ll push up the flowers and the trees.” And… I think Janice would’ve liked a nice, you know, five-star, kind of, silk-lined… With a… maybe a string and a bell just in case. Um… But I remember, you know, they came over every Sunday, uh, for bagels and cream cheese, and it was just my favorite day. And they were over, maybe this was two years ago, and, uh, everyone was in the backyard, and my dad and I were alone in the kitchen, and I asked him, I said, “Are you afraid of dying?” And he goes, “Not at all.” “I don’t remember before I was born. I’m not gonna remember after.” But then he goes, “But I’m just… I’m scared it will hurt.” And he… My dad was a huge pain pussy. He, um… It’s true. He was so afraid it would hurt. He once got a, you know, an EKG, where they put all the stickers on you. He would not pull those stickers off. He’s like, “I’m afraid it will pull my hair.” He goes, “I’m gonna let it wear off.” And he really did. I mean, it took, like, weeks. He was in a pool at one point with all these EKG stickers. He looked like a… like a dog that just had puppies. So he… he really wasn’t scared, but he was, he was scared it would hurt. And his doctor called me. We’re taking care of him now, and Janice is gone. And I’m the point person, so I answer the phone, and I take it in the hallway, and his doctor, Dr. Nortman, said, um, “Listen, we just got your dad’s blood results back, and he’s dying.” “He needs to be in the hospital.” And I said, “I don’t know what to do because I…” “We promised him no more hospital.” “He fucking hates it there.” And the doctor said, “You know, look, as a doctor, I have to suggest he go to the hospital.” “As a human being, I… you know, I think that’s fine.” “If he goes to the hospital, he’ll live a few more days, but they’ll be hospital days.” “And right now, he’s home, he’s surrounded by family, and I… I actually think that’s just the ticket.” Then he said, “The way he’s gonna die is kidney failure, which just happens to be a painless death.” “You go into a fog, eventually.” “It’s almost euphoric, and you’re just gone.” And I was so excited for my dad, and I ran into his room. I probably should’ve taken a beat. I said, “Dad, great news!” He’s like, “Huh?” I’m like… “Mitigate your expectations. You’re dying.” But I said, “No more meds.” You know, he was on, like, 40 pills a day. He goes, “No more meds?” I go, “None. You’re done.” “And we’re all gonna live here with you forever.” [audience] Aww. And… What? He knew what I meant though. And then I told him exactly how he was gonna die and that it wasn’t gonna hurt at all. And his shoulders went down, and he was so happy. We all got into bed with him. It was a great death, you know? We… we were singing old camp songs. He loved camp. And, uh, telling funny Silverman family stories. I made a mix for him of all the biggest hits from the summer he was 17 ’cause I feel like that was his happiest summer. And he knew every word to every song. It was pretty awesome. So, you know, Janice is gone, Dad is going, and I’m back on the phone with the same mortuary where we put Janice to try to get ahead of it. And I go into Dad’s room, and I said, um, “Dad, I know you wanted to be buried, but would you mind being cremated? Only because…” And… what I’m about to say is… It’s gonna be bad for the Jews. But I… I did get a deal on Janice’s plot. I really did. I, uh… “It’s called a ‘plus one,’ and you can be buried with her, like, three feet above, but you have to be cremated to fit.” And he goes, “I don’t give a fuck. I’ll be dead.” And I’m like, “Ah! You’re so easy.” “We’ll take it. Thank you.” [audience laughing, applauding] And the guy from the mortuary goes, “Uh, was that your father?” [hesitates] I said, “Yeah.” And he said, uh, “We can’t schedule a cremation for someone who’s currently living.” Like… he said it like I was the asshole. You know, I… I’m like, “You’re a Jewish mortuary. You shouldn’t even be offering cremation.” “All of a sudden, you’re a stickler?” I… What am I supposed to do? Like, cremation takes one to two weeks. Like, in Jewish, the funeral is, like, the next day. It’s… It’s very farm-to-table. And, like… [audience laughing, applauding] Huh. Oh, and then I go, “And by the way, Janice had tattoos.” I mean, it was her lips and her eyebrows, but still, she did. But, you know, then I realized we don’t need the ashes for the funeral. It’s, you know… He’s not really there. It’s… It’s for us. A funeral is for us. And, uh, I don’t think anyone’s gonna be like, “Yeah, where are the ashes?” You know, just… We just… We had a beautiful funeral, and a couple weeks later, we got the ashes, and the four sisters did a little something, you know, but… I don’t know, I… My therapist said, “Your parents, your loved ones, they’re not in the casket.” “They’re not in the ground.” “They’re… They’re in the car with you on the way to the cemetery.” “They’re in the car with you going home from the cemetery.” And I really believe that. I… I happen to be godless, but I do believe in science, and I know that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. I wrote that. And… And I believe that. I… You know, our… our loved ones, they’re not in the ground or in their bodies anymore. They’re… But their energy, their… their essence, their “-ness” is out there, and I actually think that our loved ones are watching over us. You know, maybe not all the time, but in the important moments, um, like when we’re masturbating or… Oh, Sarah. I don’t know why I would say that. I think I… Like, I need to think that in order to come, but… I just… Because the show is so sad, and then I worry, and then I go too far the other way, but I… It’s a balance. But I… I do think… I do think that our loved ones are watching over us when we masturbate. As… [giggles] As evidenced by the faint, “Oy.” Oy! Oy! [audience applauding, whooping] Really? Huh. Thanks. So, uh, you know, now my dad is dying, and, oh my God, he’s being so funny. Like, at one point, he goes, um… He musters up all his energy, and he goes, “I changed my mind.” “I want to live.” And my sister Susie, the rabbi, goes… [gasps] And I go, “Susie, he’s fucking with you.” [chuckles] And then Susie came to the show when I was on tour a couple weeks ago. And she came backstage, and she goes, “Are you kidding me?” “You were the one that gasped, and I was the one that told you he was fucking with you.” And then, um, I had to explain to her that, like, that’s not who she is in this. And… [chuckles] So we’re taking turns sitting with him and sleeping next to him, and, uh… at one point, Rory is, um… He’s sitting with my dad. And my dad’s phone went off. And I don’t understand how old people… They don’t know how to use a smartphone, but somehow they hack into it and make the volume 1,000. And, um… Also, the ringtone was “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and, uh… Rory’s like, uh, “You want me to answer this?” “It’s somebody named Steve Forman.” And my dad goes, “Okay.” So he puts it on speaker, and he holds it up. And this guy Steve Forman goes, “Schleppy, say it ain’t so!” And they have a little conversation, and it’s very sweet, and they hang up. And, uh, my dad says to Rory, “You know who that was?” “You ever hear of imitation crab?” [laughs] Hm. Rory’s like, uh, “Yeah, they, like, put it in sushi sometimes, right?” And, uh, my dad goes, “That guy invented imitation crab.” And he looked it up. He really did. “In 1970, and now he’s rich.” And so Rory goes, “That’s amazing. How’d you meet him?” And my dad goes, “Dunkin’ Donuts.” They met at Dunkin’ Donuts, and now they’re having a conversation on his deathbed. Um, a lot of my friends came by to say goodbye to him because, uh, like, my dad played poker with us. So a lot of my friends, my comic friends, um, knew him. And, uh, Jeff Ross, you know, uh, Jeffrey Ross, the, uh, Roastmaster General. [audience applauding, whooping] Um… The best roaster in town. He’s been very close to my parents for a long time. And he came to sit with him, and when he walked in, he goes, “Schleppy, I got bad news.” “I don’t think you can be my emergency contact anymore.” And, uh… He sat with him and, actually, um, Jeff introduced my dad and Janice to a friend of his, this older, uh, magician named Bernie Shine. And they all became friends, like, the last ten years or so. And they had gone… Dad and Janice had gone to see Bernie perform, like, six months earlier, you know? So Jeff is sitting with my dad, and he goes, “You want me to FaceTime Bernie so you can say goodbye?” And he said, “Okay.” And he FaceTimes him, and he holds it up. And Bernie gets on, and he says, “Donald, I’m so sorry.” And my dad said, “Bernie, your show was so bad, it killed Janice.” [audience laughing, applauding] And then he goes, “And I’m not feeling so hot either.” He was… He was killing while dying. And he was supposed to, you know… This was supposed to be it. And, you know, it was… I think we reached this time where, like, we had really said it all, and he was, like, um… like, not dying, you know? And it was, honestly, getting uncomfortable, a little bit. It was… It was awkward, and, uh… So I’m sitting with him, and, you know, we had said it all, and… I said, um, “I dunno, you wanna watch TV?” He goes, “Okay.” And we watched, um… Oh. We watched that series Beef, you know, with Ali Wong and Steven Yeun. So fucked up, dark. We love that shit, and it was great. We watched three episodes, and then I went home to sleep. And so I came in the next morning. I go, “Schleppy, you ready for episode 4?” And he goes, “I watched it.” “You watched it without me? What…” “All right, what episode are you on?” He goes, “I binged it all.” “My dad binged Beef on his deathbed…” …should be a billboard for Beef, really. He had a friend… There was a guy named Barry Tatelman. Absolute mensch. Uh, we didn’t know him until about 15 years ago. He… He searched for my dad. And, uh, he found him on Facebook, and they’ve been close the last 15 years. Why was Barry Tatelman searching for my dad? Because my dad was his camp counselor and changed his life. And, you know, ever since he died, all these old men have called into my podcast to say, you know, “Your dad was my camp counselor and… and changed my life.” Well, he molested them. Relief laugh. So, uh, Schleppy did die, painlessly, as promised. And it’s so odd, you know, because I now have no parents. And there’s really no age where you are ready, uh, to have no parents. You know, first, my stepdad, John O’Hara, who didn’t even make this special. So wonderful. And my mother, Beth Ann, who, you know, didn’t get away unscathed, per se. And then Janice, and now my dad, and… My experience is like, um… At first, I really… I felt rudderless, I think, you know? And, um… And then I kind of felt, like, identity crisis-y, you know? Like, who am I without them? You know? Like, who am I without them? And if you ever are wondering who you are, uh, take a look at the ads that are sent to you and only you on your phone. That’s who you are. Everybody knows about it now. It’s not like… You know, everyone knows targeted ads. Like, Siri’s listening to you, and Alexa’s listening to you. And everything you type into your search bar gets taken into account and fed to you. But there was a time when this was happening, and we were not aware of it. And, uh, you know, like, I would look at my phone and be like, “Oh my God, I was just talking about culottes,” or whatever. Ads would… would just pop up, and… and when I think about that time, I’m so embarrassed at how absolutely indignant I was. You know, I remember saying, “I was reading The New York Times op-ed section on my phone, and all of a sudden, an ad pops up for ilovecum.com?” “Children could be reading this!” “Why would The New York Times sell ad space to these people?” And, of course, it’s because, um, they’re not. They… That was just my phone knowing me. I don’t want you to think of me, like, typing in ilovecum.com. First of all, it’s a .org, but… I didn’t even know it was a website, really. You know, I just was typing in whatever my search words were at the time, like, you know, “penises ejaculating” or whatever, and my phone was like, “Stop typing. I’ve got you.” And it would take me there, you know? It was like, my phone’s way of saying, “When there was only one set of footprints…” “…that’s when I was carrying you.” “I got you. I got you.” I know what you were thinking. “This cum joke better have a Jesus reference, or I’m leaving.” Well, I deliver. God’s love I deliver. I said, um, cum.com so many times, you’re gonna get ads for it. So, like I said, we’re really just grieving now, and, uh… It’s interesting to me because, you know, three out of four of us are godless. Of the sisters, not society at large. That would be amazing. Um… But we’re on our WhatsApp, our sisters WhatsApp, and we’re grieving. And it does occur to me that grief is a lot like religion because we’re trying to make sense of something that is beyond our comprehension. We’re trying to understand something that may not be understandable. And, like, Susie wrote, um, “You guys, two birds landed in my windowsill, and I know it was them.” And, you know, Jodyne and Laura were like, “It was them!” And I… I wanna contribute. I… I… I hearted it. And then, um… …Laura was like, “I was at Target, and a woman walked up to me and told me I looked gorgeous in purple.” “And I know that was Janice.” And Susie and Jodyne were like, “It was Janice!” You know? And I’m like… [hesitates] Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. But it was actually what Jodyne said that got me. You know, she said, um… She said, “You guys, I farted for like four seconds.” [whispers] And I said, “It’s Dad!” [audience applauding] [audience whooping] Um… I miss him so much. I mean, I am… I’m okay. I am okay, but I just ache for him. And the thing that surprises me so much is that I don’t find myself missing, like, young, able-bodied Dad or the Dad that took care of me and went to all my games. I don’t know why this is, but I find myself missing the… the end, like, the… the final days. The quiet times when I’m taking care of him, and, like, he would literally have to tell me, uh, when he had to pee. And then I would have to take his penis and put it in a jug, and… “Penis in a jug” sounds like a… like a dessert at TGI Fridays or something. And, um… But in those times, even, like, wiping his ass and, like, changing his diaper, I was… At first, I was so… I was like, “Dad, are you horrified?” And he was like, “I don’t give a fuck.” And once I knew that, I could really, um… you know, not enjoy, but, uh, I felt honored to… I wanted to keep him clean, you know? And maybe you guys are thinking, like, “Ugh, I would never wanna, like, do that.” But you will. You will be able to do… You know, it’s like when someone goes, “I wanna get a dog, but I don’t wanna pick up its shit.” And then on day one, you’re like, “Good boy!” “Oh my God!” It just goes away, and you don’t care, and you wanna do it. And it’s in those moments when I get to keep him clean, you know? And I can tell him things, you know, like, “Dad, I love you,” and “Dad, thank you.” And also, you know, “Who’s wiping the shit out of whose tuchus now, asshole?” [audience cheering, applauding] Thank you, the Beacon Theatre, and what an incredible audience, and… Oh, good. [chuckles] Thank you.

It being Shabbas, I thought I’d give you a call. Oh, I got this new battery for my bicycle. Thank you so much for finding the guy, and I love it. Oh, I could probably go to Fargo on it, so cancel the airline tickets uh, because this has got so much power. Um, anyway, or as they say in New Hampshire, anyways, love you. Hope you’re doing well.

    "transcript":"Sebastian Maniscalco: It Ain’t Right (2025)Director:Paul DugdaleWriter:Sebastian ManiscalcoStar:Sebastian ManiscalcoRelease date:November 21, 2025 (Hulu) Sebastian Maniscalco’s newest comedy special tackles modern life’s absurdities, filmed during his record-setting “It Ain’t Right” tour. [audience cheering, muffled] [♪ electronic music playing] ♪ Unh, turn up the bass ♪ ♪ Unh, turn up the bass ♪ Give it up for Chicago, huh? [cheering grows louder] So, I haven’t, uh, been to Chicago recently, the actual city, so today I took a walk around. [cheering and applause] Looks like an apocalypse out there. You’re walking around Chicago, you wanna take a piss? Take a piss! Is anybody in charge? [audience whooping and cheering] So, I had a pretty good year. I, uh, took in the Olympics over the summer. I don’t know if anybody saw the Olympics. [cheering and applause] Yeah? I don’t know if anybody saw the guy knock the pole over with his dick. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, there was a pole vaulter who went up, and on his way down, “Poof,” knocked the pole over with his dick. Now… [audience laughing] I’ve never knocked anything over… with my dick. I… My wife has never told me, “Honey, you knocked over the pitcher of water with your dick again.” “Oh, I’m sorry. It’s a… “Let me tape it to my leg. “This is getting ridiculous. “I’m sorry you have to live with this. “This is a shame. Constantly in the way.” I even took in the Para-Olympics this year. Alright? Yeah, I thought it was exciting. You wanna feel lazy about yourself? Watch the Para-Olympics. I was watching swimming. Guy had no legs and no arms. I-It’s kinda what you need to do the sport. Now, I’m sitting there in my underwear eating popcorn, watching a guy swim with his eyelashes. I had a Fourth of July party this year. Now, I don’t like having parties ’cause everybody starts to call and ask, [in silly voice] “What can we bring?” The standard response is, “Nothing. We got it. Just bring yourself,” right? But then when they show up, they got nothing. You’re like, “Look at this shit. They didn’t got nothing.” [mouthing] To be honest, I don’t like when people bring stuff. I don’t like when people make food at their house and bring it to my house. Right? As soon as they get out of the car, it’s leaking. Everything’s leaking. There’s a trail of juice from their car to my door. The food is always unidentifiable. Always comes in a clear bowl. You have to ask, “Oh, what is…” [mouths] What… What… “What is that?” “Oh, it’s marshmallow, cinnamon, chicken.” “Chicken?” [mouthing] “Yeah, where would you like me to put it?” “Near the garbage. “It’s gonna go right from the table, “right into the hefty bag, right to the corner. I don’t think anybody’s gonna eat your cinna-chicken today.” And I had about 20 kids there, and these kids today, they have no problem talking to adults. Growing up, I was scared of other adults. These kids today come right up to you, and rude. Eight years old, the kid’s like, “Where’s my burger?” I’m like, “Hey, get the fuck away from me, kid. I don’t even like your parents.” [audience laughing and cheering] And the parents aren’t even patrolling the behavior. Now, when I’m at a party and I got my kids with me, I got an ear on what my kids are doing at all times. If I don’t hear a “please” and “thank you,” I go, “Hey, wake up or we’re gonna get the fuck outta here, alright? Please and thank you. Hello, we’re here.” Handled. He was complaining I didn’t have fireworks at the party, alright? I had fireworks that we could see, but they weren’t over our head. He’s like, “Where’s all the fireworks?” I said, “Listen, I grew up in the ’80s. “You know what we had? We had a sparkler. This– this was what we were doing.” We had snakes. I don’t know if you remember s– you lit a snake. There was ash coming out of your driveway. You thought it was the coolest thing. Also watched some TV this summer, caught up on some TV. We’re not the TV couple, my wife and I. We don’t watch a lot of TV. I’m sure everybody knows a couple, that’s, that’s all they do, telling you what to watch. Right, you see ’em, they’re like, “Oh, my God…” [pants] “have you seen…” [wheezes] [in high-pitched voice] “Have you seen The Menendez Bro… “You gotta wait till the fifth episode and then it really…” [gibberish] [normal] We try to catch up on so– uh, TV. My– my kids don’t go to camp or anything like that. They don’t go to sleepaway camp. I know that that’s popular in some families. They send their kids for four weeks to sleepaway camp. Now, if you come from an immigrant family during the summer, you don’t go nowhere! N-Nothing. I asked my father growing up, I go, “What am I doing this summer?” He’s like, “You’re in the backyard. Go in the backyard for three months.” “What?” That was– that was it. I was in the backyard bored, just… Nothing to do. Just running from side to side. Just… They had a little pool back there. It wasn’t even a pool, it was like a mosquito larva hatching nest . [audience laughing] Weird stuff happens at sleepaway camp, alright? Kid comes back after four weeks, now all of a sudden they know how to jerk someone off with their feet. Fuck that. The kid ain’t going to camp. Get in the yard, dig a hole, get in the pool. That’s it. Now, my wife and I can’t agree on what to watch. At the end of a long day, I wanna watch something that has like some– like a gun or– like a Equalizer, Denzel Washington. [imitates gunshots] “Oh, yeah, what’s going on here?” That’s what I wanna see. She’s like, “You wanna watch Love Is Blind?” Oh, yeah, I would love to watch Love Is Blind! Fifty-one years old. “I don’t think so, babe.” Sometimes we will end up on random stuff. We– we’re watching this, uh, Jeffrey Dahmer. Uh, yeah, no, that’s a good one to watch right before you go to bed. Uplifting positive message. If you don’t know who Jeffrey Dahmer was, he was eating people in the late ’80s. Turn it on. He would lure men back to his apartment, right? Guy would come in, and it smelled. The apartment smelled, right? ‘Cause he was eating people. So, the guy, as soon as he walked in, he’d be like… [gagging] “What is this smell?” And Dahmer’s just sitting in his kitchen. “I had some bad pork chops last night. Bad, bad pork chops.” Now, I’m sorry, I-I go into, uh, an apartment and it stinks, I leave. I don’t stick around for a Schlitz to find out why. I’m out. Now, my wife is the pause-it wife. I got the pause-it wife constantly asking me to pause the program. Twenty minutes in, she’s like, “Could you pause it?” “Ah. Okay, what is it? What– what are we gonna talk about?” She’s like, “You wanna take the kids to Disney World this year?” “What? “How did Mickey Mouse pop in your head… watching this?” ‘Nother 20 minutes, “Could you pause it?” “Okay, now what?” She’s like, “I don’t understand what’s going on here.” “He’s eating… people! “There’s not a lot of plot twists, babe. “I don’t know what to tell you. “He got hungry. He ate a head last night. I d– I– that’s the movie. I…” Then, I heard a big bang in the house. My wife never hears anything in the house. It was a big bang. It was like boom, boom, right? I go, “You hear that?” She goes, “No. You– you think it was the TV?” I said, “No, it’s on pause.” “Look, there’s an Amazon guy doing a drop-off at midnight.” I’m sorry, this is a little aggressive to be coming to people’s houses with nine boxes at midnight, right? I don’t know how this company works, I really don’t. Sometimes a beautiful Amazon truck pulls up, says “Amazon” on the side. Guy gets out, he’s fully decorated in Amazon paraphernalia. But then, sometimes a white rape van shows up. [mouthing] [mouthing] Guy gets out with a yellow traffic vest. I asked him, I go, “You work for Amazon?” He’s like, “No, I’m a– I’m a…” [growls] “You know where I live? How did you get here?” I mean, who’s packing these boxes? You ever get– ‘Cause no one even knows what they’re ordering anymore. Stuff just comes. I think Amazon is just sending us shit just to see if we send it back. I… I got an aquarium the other day. I’m like, “Alright, I– Somebody must have ordered an aqua–” I– I brought it in. I set it up. I set it up in the basement. My wife comes home, she’s like, “Why is there an aquarium in the basement?” I go, “You didn’t order that?” She’s like, “No,” I said, “Fuck it, we’ll leave it, looks good, I like it. Get on Amazon, get some fish, they got fish, right?” I don’t know who packs the boxes. Sometimes a big box shows up. You open it up, one dental floss with airbags. Who packed it? No one knows how this works. Look at your credit card. They don’t even itemize the items. It just says, “Amazon Marketplace” for 98 pages. Uh, y– and you pay it like an idiot. You’re like, “Alright, we must have spent four grand on Tide. Send it.” I don’t know what to tell you. This Jeff Bezos is amazing. This guy’s a genius. A genius. You ever look at, uh, Bezos 30 years ago when this guy came on the scene for the first time? The guy was a complete nerd. A nerd! Pale white, oversized suit, barely hanging onto his hair. Had some weird laugh then. [imitates booming laugh] They interviewed him 30 years ago. They’re like, “What is your company doing?” He’s like, “Well, I sell books out of my garage over the Internet.” And they laughed. They’re like, “He’s selling books? Hasn’t he ever heard of Borders?” [laughs] Now, look at him. You take a look at Bezos now. Guy is beautiful. Ripped to shreds, tan, designer clothes, on his super yacht in the Mediterranean and the boxes… keep… comin’! What is this… [chuckles] guy doing? He’s eating pasta off the Amalfi Coast and I’m getting aquariums. Delivery trucks show up all day at your house and they cause different emotions depending on what truck. FedEx pulls up, everybody gets worried, right? Paperwork is coming FedEx, “from the law offices of.” You ask your wife, “What is this?” She’s like, “I didn’t think I hit him.” “What?” UPS pulls up, exciting. It’s an electronic, it’s a– it’s an iPhone, it’s a laptop, it’s a Samsung TV set. It’s important, whatever it is. You gotta be there to sign for it. And if you’re not, they– they leave a note on your door telling you, you fucked up. But on the bottom, they tell you, “We’re gonna give you one more chance. “We’re coming back tomorrow at two o’clock. “Get your shit together. Someone’s gotta be here or it’s going back to Taiwan.” Everybody’s anxious. They’re like, “Who’s taking off work tomorrow? They’re coming back! Take the sick day!” Amazon don’t play around with that. No note, no nothing. They’ll throw the box… [blows sharply] right over the bush. [imitates popping sound] They’ll take a picture. “Let’s go. Bezos needs fuel. “Be– Bezos needs fuel. “He’s in Ibiza. Forget it. Who cares if it breaks?” [audience applauds] I don’t know, maybe I’m looking at things from, you know, I’m 51 now, just turned 51 this summer. Yeah. And listen, I just– I can’t do things that I used to do. Listen, I used to be– I used to be able to put my socks on. Standing up. No problem. Now I gotta sit on the edge of my bed and hope to God… hope to God my ankle rests on my knee long enough. I’m bringing body parts to me. Then, I gotta take the sock, I gotta roll it. [laughs] I gotta roll it into a doughnut, alright? ‘Cause I got sciatic pain ripping down my right leg. I don’t have enough strength in my right leg to fight through an open sock. I gotta roll it on like a condom. I’m putting my socks on like a rubber. What’s happening to me? I’m constantly exhausted, tired. Is anybody getting up in the morning refreshed? [audience members] No. Is anybody getting out of bed going, “Whoa, I had a great sleep!” I get up, I feel worse than when I went to bed. I’m like, “Did I sleep last night? What the hell happened?” I’m waking up my wife with the sounds coming out of my body. Three o’clock in the morning, she’s like, “Are you eating potato chips?” “What? “No, that’s my knees extending onto the floor “for my ninth piss. “Go back to bed, babe. I didn’t bring a can of Pringles into the bed.” And speaking of going to the bathroom, I took my son to the bathroom at a restaurant, and I was watching him go. I was jealous at the strength of his stream. He was chipping porcelain off the back of the bowl. I get up in the middle of the night, my dick is inverted. I can’t find it, right? And when I go to the bathroom, it’s two streams. I’m– I need two toilets now. I’m pissing mist! I went to the doctor, he said, I have a mild case of sleep apnea, alright? He said, “You need to start sleeping with sleep tape over your mouth.” This is where I’m at. I’m in bed with my wife, and I have to tap her before we go to bed, and I have to ask her, “Babe, do you need… “Do you need to talk anymore “because I’m gonna duct tape my mouth shut so I don’t pass away in my sleep.” “What?” I look like a hostage in a cave in Afghanistan. If someone came to rob my house, they would look at me and go, “Someone was already here. Let’s go. “Let’s go. There’s nothing left. They tied him up. “He’s got a gag in his mouth. Let’s go. We’re done.” It’s even affected my love life, right? My wife, the other night, got up in the middle of the night. She’s like, “Ah, what?” “What?” You know? And I’m like, hold on, let me take… [audience laughing] During lovemaking, I’m getting– I’m getting charley horses. This– do you ever have this happen? Right– right in the middle, I’m like, “God, get off! Oh, my God! I can’t. I can’t get rid of it, babe, I…” Right? This is what she’s looking at, fully erect, walking around, walking around the bedroom, right? You ca– you can’t come back after that. You can’t get back in the– in the bed and, “Okay, come on, get on, get on top.” She’s like, “That’s alright, we’ll– we’ll do it next month. “I’m– I’m good, I– I just, I can’t unsee what I just saw, I don’t know what the hell’s going on, but… we’re good.” I ruptured my bicep, went to the doctor for that. He’s like, “Oh, yeah, no, you ruptured it. What’d you do?” I was like, “I don’t know. Woke up. Woke up, had a hole in my arm. “Shit’s snapping off in the middle of the night, Doc. I’m not lifting any heavy stuff. I don’t know what’s going on.” He’s like, “Well, how long have you had that?” I said, “I don’t know. I don’t look in a mirror anymore.” If you’re in your 20s or 30s, you’re living in a mirror. You can’t wait, right? You’re like, “Oh, my God, can you…” You’re north of 50? Every eight weeks, you catch a glance. You’re like, [in a high-pitched voice] “What the fuck is this?” [normal] You ever look at yourself in the mirror and just– I mean naked, and– and just take it in? I was looking, my belly button is not centered with the rest of my body anymore. It’s off to the left, it collapsed. I don’t know what happened. I asked my wife, I go, “Babe…” And she’s like, “Yeah, no, that’s been that way for a year.” “What? You don’t tell… You don’t tell me my belly button left?” I used to have a beautiful ass. Beautiful, right? You ever catch your backside? I was in a hotel room looking in the mirror. I caught my backside. I thought somebody else was in the room! No ass, gone. It– it bleeds into my hamstrings. My crack, no crack anymore. Disappeared into my nuts. My crack is gone! It’s a slow decay. And it’s not gonna get any better. This– it’s all going downhill. We were on vacation, right? I was sitting there on the beach. I got one kid on this side, one kid on that side. My wife’s like, “Oh, my God, this is such a beautiful picture. Let me take a photo of you.” Right? She snaps it, I look at it, right? I have, I don’t know, it’s like an udder. It’s like a– it’s like an orangutan tit. I don’t know when this happened. I used to have a beautiful chest plate. I got orangutan tits now. I just refuse to believe this is what 51 feels like. I have to have something, like a disease or something, right? I went to a rheumatologist. And, listen, I don’t even like going to the doctor. I– I really don’t. It’s the same thing every time with the clipboard. Go over there, fill it out for four hours, right? Two-hundred and eighty-five pages of questions. There’s one question, “How many alcoholic beverages do you consume in one week?” [audience member] Whoo! The first answer is one glass. Who circles that? I don’t know anybody in my life that’s doing one glass a week, especially in Chicago. You guys are drinking constantly, right? Oh, yeah. Every time I call my friends in Chicago, “What are you doing?” “Fuckin’ hammered, bro. “Fuckin’ hammered! Can’t see shit.” It’s noon on a Tuesday. So, I go into the doctor, and it’s weird. They come out, and they ask you to come in. They say, your name is Sebastian. [in sluggish voice] “Okay. Here I come. Okay.” [normal] I always go the wrong way, like I know. I’m like, “Alright, this way? No. Okay. I’m sorry. This way?” [mumbles] I have no memory anymore. No memory. Gone. The– the nurse is like, “Just go down the double doors, take a left and at the–” “Hey, let’s… Let me write this down. I lost you at double doors.” Gone. I walk in, they got that smock. I always put it on like a robe. I always put it on so everything is exposed. And I don’t sit, I just walk around. I just walk around the doctor’s office. Nurse comes in, she’s like, “Oh, my God, please, just, no. That– it goes the other way, sir.” I go, “Okay, but I have no crack. “Just so you know, this might be a better view. “‘Cause the backside, nothing. It’s just a pancake right into the legs.” She’s like, “We’re gonna need some urine.” I’m like, “God, I don’t like the urine sample.” Right? It’s tough, you go in there, right? There’s a fill line, there’s a lot of pressure to fill that thing up. And generally speaking, I don’t look at my own urine. I go, I flush, I leave. But when you put it in a cup, you– you know, you… You tend to take a glance. And I gotta tell you people something, my sample? Beautiful! Like Pinot Grigio! Uh, no foam on it, nothing. You could read a newspaper right through the glass, really proud of it. And then there’s no way you could look cool coming out of the doctor’s office holding your own urine. There’s– you– you turn into a completely different human being, right? You walk out, you’re like, “I got my pee-pee. “Where do I put my pee-pee? You told me to make pee-pee for you, so here’s my pee-pee cup.” You ever try handing it to a nurse? Like, “No, we don’t take the piss! “Please! Put it over there with the rest.” Right? Now, I’m sorry, I don’t think everybody’s urine should be on display for other patients to see, right? I put mine next to a guy’s that looked like scotch! [mouths] Scotch. Scotch. Like, I’m like, I don’t know what he’s got, but I think I’m gonna be okay. Mine looks good. This looks like death, alright? If I’m pissing scotch, I don’t even hand that in. I throw it back in the bowl. I don’t even bother. I tell everybody, “I’m gonna go die in my sleep tonight.” I’m not handing in root beer as a sample. So, the school year started about, I don’t know, a month and a half ago. Right? Taking the kids to school. That’s what I like to do. I like to take ’em in the morning with my wife. Now, first day of school… I knew there was not gonna be a lot of parking near the school. It’s in a residential area. So, that morning I was planning in my head where to park, alright? This is what men do prior to getting into a vehicle with their family. We’re planning. You probably did it tonight. And most men drive the car. I– I am in control of the driving duties in my family. And I think I speak for everybody in the room, generally speaking, ladies, okay, generally. Take it easy. Men tend to drive, and the lady is in the passenger seat. Am– am I accurate by saying that? [Sebastian Maniscalco] Okay. Like– like, guy, did you drive tonight? Yes. Guy, you drive? No, of course. The guy… The one guy I pick on, “No, I sat in the bitch seat tonight, “and my– my wife– my wife generally drives me everywhere, ’cause I have no nuts.” I– it’s okay, guy. It’s– it’s okay. Don’t worry about it. But most… [laughs] If I went around the room… I would predict 90% of the men drive. Now, we don’t have this discussion in my household. It’s– everybody has assigned seats in the car. We don’t– me and my wife are not in the driveway debating, “You wanna drive tonight?” [mumbles] [in squeaky voice] “Wanna drive?” “No.” [normal] No, we go and we leave. Now, first day of school… the parking was gonna be awful. It’s in a residential area. So, while I was at the house, I was trying to figure out where I was going to park. This is what men do, ladies. We’re– we’re looking into the future, right? And sometimes we don’t respond to you. A lot of women complain, when they talk to their boyfriend or husband, that they don’t get a response, right? It’s because we’re thinking. Like, my wife came down and she started asking questions. She’s like, “Do you wanna leave at 8:00?” I didn’t even hear it. I’m sitting there going, “Now, if I take a right on the street…” Like, you probably did it tonight, you’re like, “Okay, if I take the Kennedy at this hour…” This is what men are doing, we’re trying to plan out where we’re going. Now, we get into the car. Now, my wife has driven, she just– she just doesn’t know how to drive. Believe me, she thinks she knows. My wife likes to talk to me while she drives. Now, when I’m driving, I talk to the windshield, right? She talks to me, and I go, “Yeah, I think we should maybe go to your mother’s for Christmas.” Right? But my wife, she talks, she’s like, “You know what, we should…” And she’s hitting shit, she’s taking out… She took out a recycling bin, right? [imitates popping sound] I’m like, “Jesus!” She didn’t even see it, she didn’t even know she hit it! I go, “You hit it!” And she’s like, “I did?” “Yeah, you did! Get your foot off the air conditioner!” She’s got her foot up by the air, what is that? So, my plan was to park four blocks away and we would walk in. Now, at four blocks, I turn to my wife, I go, “Just, you know, walk in. Yeah? Let’s just walk in. Not gonna be anything up there.” She’s like, “No, no, you go up there. No. There’ll be spots. There’ll be spots.” Now, I’ve been married 11 years. I don’t even respond to that. Five years in, I would have responded to that. Now I have a conversation in my head… of what I wanna say. I wanted to say, “There’s not gonna be nothing up there!” Right, that’s what I wanted to say. But what she saw was just… [in high-pitch voice] “Yeah, okay. There? Up there? Yeah.” [mouths] Nothing. There’s nothing. So, we get in the car… and on the weekends, you gotta figure out what to do with the kids. Where are we going? Where are we gonna kill time? Right? Went to the zoo, right? And the zoo generally is– is boring, but you have to go. We go up to pay, right? My wife wants the package. Any membership, my wife wants everything. She’s like, “Let’s just get the year membership.” I go, “Babe, this is the only time we’re ever coming to the zoo.” When the kids are in their 30s, they’re gonna go, “Remember that one time we went to the zoo? “This is it. This is the one time. I’m not coming back here.” Zoo’s boring. There’s nothing to do there. Listen, and I know some of you are going, “How dare you? “How dare you support… the zoo? “Those are wild animals. They are in captivity, and you’re supporting that?” Listen, I get it. I understand. But I need four hours to kill, so we’re gonna go look at sad animals. I don’t know what to tell you. Half of the animals aren’t even in the cage. I went to go look at the bears. I asked the guy, I go, “Where’s the bear?” He’s like, “Nah, he ain’t– he ain’t in today.” “He ain’t in? What’d he take the day off? “He didn’t come to work? He’s back there. Isn’t he… Wh-what is he…” “Nah, he’s in the back. He’s getting his shots. He’s getting his vaccines.” I said, “Okay, bring that out here.” I wanna see that, alright? Maybe he gets mad. He takes a claw to the guy’s face. I wanna see somebody get their head ripped off for $90 a head. “Bring out the bear, guy.” No. We go to the Los Angeles Zoo, and I don’t know what’s going on. Budget cuts or what? There’s shit missing at the zoo. There’s… We– we went to– we went to go look at the kangaroo exhibit. I thought there was gonna be a 20-foot fence between us and the kangaroo. Nothing. Couple bushes, us and a kangaroo just staring right at us. And this thing wasn’t even hopping. It was just– it was just walking around. Just walking around the cage. My son’s like, “Why isn’t it hopping, Daddy?” I said, “I don’t know. They must have snipped off his hamstrings ’cause they can’t afford the fence.” He’s walking around like he’s at a nightclub. What the hell’s going on here? Went to go feed the giraffes. I told my kids, alright, I said, “Grab the salad. Start feeding this thing. Come on.” This is how I address them. I don’t– I don’t play the whole… [enthusiastically] “Let’s go feed the giraffe!” [normal] No. “Get it, let’s go, I’m bored. Come on, I wanna get outta here.” They start feeding this thing, guy comes out that works there, he’s like, “Ah, excuse me, hey, excuse me, sir, that’s $15 dollars per kid to feed the giraffe.” I go, “Guy, don’t nickel and dime me on the giraffe feed. “They’re your giraffes. You’re gonna charge me to feed your giraffe?” I said, “Drop the salad. Let’s get out of here. It’s a scam. “The whole thing’s a scam. “Keep it moving. Let’s go home.” ‘Nother thing we did over the summer, we went to Universal Studios, alright? [audience whooping] No, nothin’ “whoo!” Listen, I don’t– I don’t buy tickets anywhere. I just go and do point of sale. Right? I go to the parking garage, I pull up to the cabin, guy’s yelling, “Seventy dollars. [in a high-pitched voice] Seventy dollars!” [normal] That’s not a normal price for parking. You don’t shout that from a cabin, alright? It it’s $70, you come out of the cabin, you apologize. “I’m sorry, this is criminal, what they’re doing to people. “I don’t blame you if you leave, I’m just trying to feed my family.” That’s what I wanna hear on a $70 charge. Now, my wife has no price sensitivity. I tap her, I go, “This guy’s charging $70.” She’s like, “Shut up, pay it, just pay it.” And I took out cash, and by the way, you take out cash nowadays, it’s like kryptonite. This kid was in his early 20s, he’s like, “What is that?” I said, “It’s money, it’s used for goods and services.” He’s like, “We don’t– we don’t have a register, I can’t even… You got a Zelle or a Venmo?” I go, “No, I don’t got Venmo! I got this. I…” No, some people do Venmo. Maybe you went out to dinner before the show, somebody paid, and then the rest of the group said, “No, we’ll Venmo you later.” “No, you pay me now!” Right? You… You could leave here tonight and wrap yourself around a tree. Where does that leave me? Out 300 for the dinner. Now, I gotta go to your funeral and talk to your family and tell them, “Listen… “You know, the night he died, he was gonna… “he was gonna Venmo me three– $300. “So, if you could just settle up with me “right here near the casket, “I’ll– I’ll be on my way. “Uh, sorry for your loss, “but, uh, he had a lot, some lamb chops “and a appetizer that night that was expensive, you know, and, uh, died on a full stomach, but…” So, I pay the guy, right, and I’m going up the ramp. Of course, I can’t let it go. I gotta talk to my wife about it. Uh, I can’t believe $70. Trying to figure out how much they’re making on parking. You ever do that? You ever go, “How many spots you think each level’s got? I wanna multiply it by 70.” Of course, she’s telling me where to park. Don’t tell us where to park, ladies. We know where we’re going. We’re going away from everything. My wife’s always trying to tell me to get– get in there. No, even if we fit in there, we would all have to exit through the sunroof because the doors won’t open, babe. Let me just find a bigger spot. Now, we get out of the car, my daughter looks up at me, she goes, “Daddy, could I get on your shoulders?” Now, listen… I’m not gonna deprive my beautiful daughter of a ride on her father’s shoulders, but I got problems. So, I’m like, “Yeah, no, of course. [in high-pitched voice] “You wanna get on– you wanna get on… Argh.” I said, “Get on. Get on Daddy’s shoulders.” [normal] Now, as soon as she gets on, in my head, I’m like, “There’s no way. There’s no way I’m getting up from this.” And my wife is walking with my son into the elevator like she married a 35-year-old man. And I’m screaming, “Get back, I can’t get up! Come back!” Now, my wife has a problem with my tone. She runs back, she’s like, “What, are you crazy? What, are you nuts? Yelling across a parking lot at me?” I go, babe, “How would you like me to address you… “in these situations? What do you want me to do? W-what do you want me…” [in cheerful voice] “Hey, babe, hey, babe. “Co– come back here, you silly goose. “Oh, no, I just need some help. I have a torn right meniscus. “I have vertebra displacement, a pinched nerve. “Come on, now. Just looking for help, babe. Golly!” [normal] So, we go up to the booth to pay at Universal, alright? Now, I got no tickets, nothing. The guy working is half alive. Half alive. Right? He’s playing a video game. Again, in his early 20s. And everybody’s worried about AI and robots. “Oh, they’re gonna take the jobs.” Let ’em. I don’t wanna deal with this shit anymore. Alright? I don’t want to deal with a 21-year-old kid with an attitude, alright? Every time you go, you ask a question, you get an eye roll. [microphone pops] I’d rather have a, [in a robotic voice] “Eh, right away, sir, let me go get your ticket, sir. Here’s your ticket, sir. Enjoy your day.” [normal] That’s what I want now. And listen, I’m not transactional. I goof around with the guy. I’m sarcastic. Nobody gets sarcasm anymore. I went up to the guy, I go, “You got an hour pass? I’ll rip through the park in one hour.” He’s like, “No, we don’t got that.” Ah… Forget– forget connecting with this kid. Forget it. I go, “I got a son here. He’s five. Could he ride any of these rides?” He’s like, “I don’t know. Is that your son?” “Yeah, this is him. I brought him. He’s right here.” He’s like, “I don’t know, he’s short. How tall? How tall is he?” This tall, guy, you’re looking right at him, alright? I didn’t measure him before we came here. Alright? I barely got his socks on. Him and I have a problem putting on our socks. So, I don’t know. I’m 5’10”. What’s this? Two feet? He’s two feet. You got anything for two-footers behind the gates? Come on, guy. Get off the fentanyl and let me in. Alright? I don’t know what you’re on, but I ain’t on anything. I’m on a… time clock. Let’s go. So, he goes, “Uh, we got, uh, we got an express pass.” I said, okay, now we’re talking my language. Express, fast. What’s your– I asked him, “What’s your idea of express? Might be a lot different than mine?” My idea of an express pass, soon as you get to the ride, poof. You’re up. You’re on it. You’re in the air. You ain’t waiting for nobody. No line, no nothing. Right past Make-A-Wish. “Hi, how you doing? “I got my express pass. Where do I go? “I paid 90 extra for the express pass. Where is the ride? Bring it down.” Right? That’s what I… [chuckles] That’s what I’m looking for. That was a joke. Listen, I would never do that. I would never hurdle a Make-A-Wish kid. I would never do that. Have we all thought about it? Yeah. That’s why it’s… So, I said, “Just forget it. Just ring me up for whatever the hell you got, okay?” Now, I had a price in my head what the thing was gonna cost. Right? He’s like, “It’s gonna be 1,900.” Nineteen hundred dollars? I was thinking 250 tops for a family of four to look at a minion and go home. This guy hits me with two grand. Listen, alright, just ring it up, alright? What am I gonna do? I paid 70 on the parking. What am I gonna do? I’m– I’m 70 in. What, I go back to my car and lose the 70? No, let’s spend– let’s spend the two grand. So, he’s like, “I’m gonna need everybody’s first and last name.” What is with this personal information on transactions? They do this at Target. You ring something up, “Zip code, please.” Why? You gonna murder my family tonight? Just ring up the toothbrush, guy. You don’t need my address. And you don’t ask Italian people for personal information. We get very nervous when strangers start asking us stuff like that. That’s why Italians, we give fake names, if we ever… First and last, I give– the whole family got a fake name now. Now, he prints the tickets, and on the tickets are the fake names. And I’m thinking, “Shit, this could be a problem moving forward, right?” Now, I take the tickets, we go up to the turnstile, right? Now, my family is unaware that their names have changed. Now, if my wife was paying– see, my wife never pays attention to what I’m doing. Now, if my wife was paying and she was giving fake names, I would be in on that. I’m like, “Okay, fake names today.” Fake names? I would tell the kids, “You got fake names. “Don’t respond to your name today. Respond to the name that we’re gonna call you.” Okay, now, my wife don’t do any of this. By– by the way, my wife would not give fake names. She would give the Social Security card, the fingerprints, the wiring information, steal it, take it all. So, my daughter’s name is Sarafina. At the park, her name is Laura. Now, the guy goes, “Laura.” My wife’s like… [shudders] “There’s no Laura here.” I go, “Shut up, they’re gonna murder our family. “Just assume the name Anastasia. Okay, and Anastasia’s here.” Now, we walk in, start looking around at people. It’s all I do, is look at people. Anywhere I go, at the airport, I was at the airport this week, I honed in on a guy. You ever hone in on people? Start making up a story about the person in your head? I’m looking at this guy going, “How the hell did this guy book a ticket?” Just– just on the look alone. Just… Like, how did you make it through the Expedia web page to get to the purchase ticket icon? You did it tonight. When you were sitting here tonight, you were looking at people walk in, right? Don’t tell me you didn’t start talking to your wife, going, “Look at this shit that just walked in. Look at this guy.” [audience member whistles] We decided in Universal to go one of these hibachi places where they, uh, where they grill right in front of you, alright? I figured it’d be fun for the kids, the kids never been to one. If you don’t know what, like, a hibachi is, they start whipping, they just start whipping shrimp at your head and you’re supposed to catch it in your mouth. Now… We’re 20 minutes into the meal, there’s no food in here. I told the chef, I go, “Guy, let’s get– “Come on, let’s– let’s get going with the shrimp here. “My son has got his mouth open for 20 minutes, there’s– there’s no shrimp in it.” He’s like, “No, we don’t do that anymore.” I go, “Why not?” He goes, “Well, a few years back, “the chef threw a shrimp at somebody, “they went to go get it, they fell off the chair and broke their neck and died.” I– “Wh– what?” “Yeah, they sued the place. Now, we can’t…” It’s always one person that fucks it up for the rest of us, right? ‘Cause this guy couldn’t catch the shrimp in his head… now my son’s gotta eat off a plate. [audience laughing] And if that happened in my family, we would make fun of the guy who died. At holiday parties you go, “Remember when Frank tried to jump and get the… “Fuckin’ died? Remember that? Yeah, what an asshole.” That– that’s it. Nobody sues anybody. You just– you– you lost. You know? I mean… So, we’re going through the park. We hit the Harry Potter village. I know we got Harry Potter. I– listen, I haven’t read one book. I haven’t seen the movie. [audience member cheers] Alright? But I’m looking around Harry Potter world. Weird. Weird people at Harry Potter world. Guy walking around with a cape, a hat, a magic stick. He come up to my family, [in British accent] “Hello, everybody! Hello!” [normal] And he didn’t even work there. He came to the park as a wizard. I… Anybody in his family tell him, “John, you can’t do this anymore! “You’re 68 years old! Come home! We need you, John.” Now, after that, we go to a play. It’s in the middle of the park. We sit down on a bench. I start goofing around with my son. We roughhouse, me and him. Give him a couple shots to the ribs. [audience laughing] And as I’m doing this, I feel a guy sit next to me, right? I’m like, “Oh, God.” You ever have somebody sit next to you but you don’t wanna look at ’em? You kinda give ’em a, you know, a little side eye? See… Maybe– maybe it happened tonight. Maybe somebody sat next to you and you wanted to see what– you know, who they were, or what– so you, you know, go down and fiddle with your shoe. and then come up. “Oh, okay, yeah.” So, I sized this guy’s whole family up. Three daughters, a wife. He’s in his mid-40s. Starts talking to me. He’s right in on me, right? Right in. Like we came to the park together. Starts talking to me, he’s like, [in muffled voice] “What time does this– what time does this start?” [normal] This guy’s got no teeth. No teeth! Now, all I’m saying is prioritize your life! You don’t go to Universal… and then get teeth! You get teeth… [audience laughing and cheering] …then you go to Universal! The teeth cost as much as the tickets! God bless Chicago, I love you. Thank you for coming to the show tonight. [♪ electronic music playing] [audience member whoops] ♪ Unh, turn up the bass ♪ [audience applauding] [cheering and applause continues] Hey-hey! Hey-hey!

    "transcript":"Tom Segura: Teacher (2025)Release Date:December 24, 2025Location:Filmed at the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Tom Segura‘sTeacheris the comedy special equivalent of a man showing you photos from his vacation and expecting applause. For nearly an hour, Segura takes the stage in Milwaukee to deliver what can only be described as the creative exhaust of someone who stopped needing to be funny a long time ago. The title promises pedagogy; what we get is a man who has learned nothing and has nothing to teach. The first twenty minutes are an inventory of bodily functions that would embarrass a middle-schooler. Segura ranks his favorite ways to expel waste from his body. He discusses sharting with the self-satisfaction of someone who believes he invented the concept. He recounts flying with the Blue Angels—an anecdote designed to remind us of his celebrity access—and the punchline, inevitably, involves his fear of defecating at high altitude. There is a geometry to hack comedy, and Segura has mastered it: take any subject, add excrement, wait for the laugh track. And about that laughter. There’s something hollow in the room, a dutiful quality to the audience response that suggests people laughing because they paid for tickets, not because anything surprised them. The comedian who once had timing now has only tempo—a metronomic delivery of setups and punchlines that land with the predictability of a metronome. Nothing detonates. Everything simply arrives. The references are museum pieces. Jared from Subway. Guantanamo Bay. Material that might have been edgy during the Obama administration now feels like comedy archaeology. Segura has stopped living in the present tense. He performs as if the world froze the moment he got rich, and in a sense, for him, it did. Because that’s the rot at the center ofTeacher: Segura has become the thing comedians are supposed to mock. He’s the wealthy man performing accessibility, the trust-fund kid who once cosplayed as a struggling comic and now can’t stop telling you about his sports cars, his Italian vacations, his proximity to military aircraft. When he calls pickleball a substitute sport for soft people, you feel the irony collapse on itself—here is a man whose entire act has become a substitute for actual comedy, performed for audiences too polite to demand their money back. The podcast industrial complex created this. Years ofYour Mom’s House, hours of unfiltered conversation, have done to Segura what they do to most comedians foolish enough to expose their personalities without filter: they’ve worn away the mystique, revealed the smallness, and replaced hunger with complacency. Podcasting doesn’t sharpen comics; it domesticates them. Segura now performs like a man who has talked so much that he’s forgotten how to say anything. There’s a moment in the special where Segura discusses wanting to kill his wife—an extended bit about pushing her off subway platforms and Hawaiian cliffs. It’s meant to be dark, intimate, the comedy of marital proximity. Instead, it plays like a man who heard that confessional material works and decided to manufacture some. The transgression is cosmetic. Nothing is at stake. He knows she’s alive, we know she’s alive, and the bit exists only to fill time between references to his digestive system. Segura used to be different. InCompletely NormalandMostly Stories, he was hungrier, less insulated, more willing to find comedy in his own failures rather than in his privileges. That comic is gone now, replaced by a simulacrum who hits his marks and collects his check. Each special since the peak has been observably worse than the last, a declining curve thatTeacherextends toward its logical conclusion: a man on stage with nothing left to prove and nothing left to say. The special ends with a prolonged AIDS joke—Segura claiming he probably contracted HIV from unprotected sex in Tunisia decades ago, that his wife has it, his children have it, even Bill Belichick has it. It’s meant as absurdist punctuation, a shock to send the audience home buzzing. Instead, it arrives with the desperation of a comic who knows he hasn’t earned his closer and hopes volume will substitute for wit. The crowd cheers. The lights fade. And somewhere, the comedian Tom Segura used to be watches from a distance, wondering what happened. Tom Segura: Teacher (2025) | Transcript [street noises rise slowly] [crowd cheering faintly] [announcer] Milwaukee, please welcome Tom Segura. [“Time 4 Sum Aksion” by Redman plays] ♪ Time, time for some Time for some action ♪ ♪ Time, time for some Time for some action… ♪ ♪ Let’s get ready to rumble ♪ ♪ In this corner we have The funk bodysnatcher ♪ ♪ P-Funkadelic and I gat ya Hard enough that I can… ♪ All right, thank you very much! [crowd whoops] Thank you. You guys are amazing, thanks. Yeah, I love you too. You’re so well-behaved. [crowd laughs] It’s not always like this. You know that, right? We, uh… We had a fight in the front row last week at a show. Yeah, and you fucking notice when it’s in the front row. You notice. And, um… you know, normally, we try to put that out pretty quickly, but the, uh, the guy that started the fight was just so old. [crowd laughs] When security descended upon him, I was just like, “Wait.” You know? Like, “Let him do it,” you know. [crowd laughs] It’s probably his last fight, you know. I’m sure it was. He was very old, and he was punching another guy, but he was… you know, he was making, like, old sounds as he was like… “Bughh…” Like, it was… [crowd laughing] Even the guy getting hit was like, “I don’t give a shit.” Like… “I don’t feel this.” And then… Then the older guy, he just kind of tuckered out, you know. He was, “Aww…” And he just… He just kind of faded. And then as security was escorting him up the aisle, I looked and I was like, “Oh, I think that’s a woman.” [crowd laughing] It was the hair. You know how women will sometimes hit a certain age where they don’t want you to try to fuck them anymore, and… the hair goes first, you know. They just go… [buzzing] Then we all go, “Oh yeah. Don’t try to touch her. I got it.” This goes… [whooshes] The vagina closes, the hair goes, and we all go, “She’s off-limits.” So… Whoever it was, rest in peace. [crowd laughs] I, uh… [chuckles] I just got back from my favorite place. I was in Italy, which I absolutely love. Yeah… it’s the greatest. It is the greatest. And… My phone knows that I love Italy, just like our phones know everything about us now. It was fun, I think about a decade ago, when we would like kind of debate, “Wouldn’t it be crazy if this thing was listening to everything we said?” And then now we’re like, “Oh yeah, this records everything.” Everything I say, text, think, it’s just there. Unless you’re one of these people who happens to believe, you’re like, “Oh yeah, you know, I was having a conversation with someone about a bread basket from Croatia in the 1700s, and then I opened my Gmail, and it was like, ‘You looking for a Croatian bread basket?'” [crowd laughs] You’re like, “Isn’t that a wild coincidence?” Well, yeah. I talk about Italy all the time, and every time I open my phone, social media is just Italy. It’s Italian landscapes, Italian recipes, Italian women’s feet, and I go “like, like, like,” right? [crowd laughs] But whenever I see landscape shots of Italy, there’s always a guy on a Vespa, you know? Those little scooters, and they’re zipping around, and they’re dreaming of marinara, or whatever they do. [crowd laughs] [vrooming] Yeah. And whenever I see a guy on a Vespa, internally to myself, I go, “That’s gay.” Right? [crowd laughing] But when you’re there and you see one, you’re like, “No one will know, right?” So I rented one, and… [crowd laughing] It was the single most joyful experience of my entire life, including the birth of my children. It was fucking amazing. I was making up reasons to take that thing out. I was just like, “We don’t have any butternut squash. I gotta go.” Couple days into it, I started making up a narrative in my head. I was like, “This is the same as a Harley. This is the same shit.” This is my hog. [vrooms] [crowd laughs] Another day went by, I was like, “I am getting one of these… as soon as I get back.” I started shopping online. “Do I want a blue one? Yeah.” “Do I want a basket? Fuck yeah, I want a basket on that.” And then I got back to the US of A, and within moments, I was like, “Oh, there’s not a fucking chance.” Like… [crowd laughs] “I’ll get beat to death at a red light… in one of these,” and that’s when you realize that Vespas are the pickleball of the motorbike world. They are… [crowd laughs and applauds] [cheers and applause] Yeah! It is simply a substitute for the real thing. Just say you suck at tennis, you fucking cuck. Like… Nobody wants to hear that you’re excelling at a make-believe sport. Now… “No, but it’s so social.” [mock babbling] [crowd laughs] “Anyone can do it.” That’s why you do it. You’re soft. Now… I did something very, very fun recently. I got to fly with the Blue Angels. I don’t know if you know what that is. Oh, wow. Wow! For those of you that don’t know, that is the US Navy’s aerial show program. They put on shows all over our country that are unbelievable. These are elite fighter pilots that are flying in fighter jets 18 inches apart, and they do these wild, acrobatic stunts. And I went to the show, and it was amazing. Then afterwards, I met one of the organizers, and very casually, I was like, “Yeah, I wish I could go up in one of those.” They were like, “Yeah, you can.” And I go, “What the fuck, really?” [crowd laughs] They go, “Yeah, if you come to Pensacola, Florida.” And I was like, “Ugh!” [crowd laughing] “Okay.” So… I went. I went to Florida. I went to the base, and I met one of the pilots. This dude looked like he was designed in a lab, and then AI just shit him out, okay? This is one of the most beautiful men… I think about this guy every day, okay? [crowd laughs] My last thought before I go to bed at night is his jawline, and then I go, “Hmm… mm,” then I fall asleep. So I walk up to him, I go, “Hey, I’m Tom.” And he goes, “I’m Seven.” Whatever you say, Daddy. Uh… If you’re a seven, I’d hate to meet a ten, you know what I mean? So Seven tells me, “We’re gonna do some wild stuff up there.” “So don’t eat a lot, because if you eat a lot, you will definitely throw up.” And I go, “Oh, wow, what if I throw up?” He goes, “I’ll give you a little baggie, and you can puke in that.” I go, “Thanks, dog.” “What if I shit?” And he goes, “People don’t shit.” You don’t know who you’re talking to right now, do you? We went up for 45 minutes. We flew vertically, we did barrel rolls, we flew Mach 1.2, we pulled seven and a half Gs. It was the most thrilling 45 minutes of my entire life. But when I got back, I realized something. I realized that we are the only country on Earth where when you see a fleet of fighter jets approaching, you know something cool is gonna happen. [crowd laughing] It’s just us. [cheers and applause] Right? Like… Dude, we send them to the Daytona 500 to kick shit off, so that every asshole there can go… [chuckling] “Look at that.” “That’s fucking cool.” You’re like, “Yeah, here.” But if you’re in the Hindu Kush province of Afghanistan, and you see seven F-22s, you’re not like, “Oh, yeah, today’s the race.” [crowd laughing] You know, you just go… [grunts] And that’s it. That’s the last fucking sound you ever make before you hear… [puffs] And then… there goes your mom’s village. All right, so… [chants]USA…Now… [scattered whooping] Well, sure. Why not? You know, I didn’t puke, and I didn’t shit, but… when I was in Houston about a month ago, I sharted. Here’s what happened. [crowd laughs] If you were gonna make a list of the best places to shart, and I don’t know why you would, but if you did, number one is the bathroom. And that’s where I was. I was in a public restroom, and I was at the urinal. I was just enjoying a delightful afternoon pee, you know? Like a 90-second one, you know, where your mind just kind of goes. Stream of consciousness takes over. You’re just lost, and like, “Are birds real, or are they honing devices? I don’t know.” “Jesus, how big were Aretha Franklin’s tits,” you know? You ever think about that? Everyone talks about Dolly Parton’s tits. Did you ever look at Aretha Franklin’s tits? It looked like she was nursing seal pups. It’s insane. If she couldn’t sing, she’d be serving lunch. You know what I mean? Those are some tits. So… [chuckles quietly] [crowd laughs] I’m pissing… and it’s great. My wife always gives me shit, by the way. She’s like, “You enjoy your bodily functions so much.” I’m like, “Just let me live my life.” I mean, I do like peeing. I like sneezing more. If you don’t enjoy an open-air, reckless, violent sneeze, you’re a fucking communist, okay? It’s the best. Yeah, you know what I mean? No one’s around, you go… [loud babbling] One of those, and you’re like, “What the fuck?” “Don’t talk to me.” I love it. Coming’s the best, obviously. I’m not gonna argue that point. So, I go, coming, sneezing, nice pee, emergency shit, um… I really like stretching in bed right after I wake up, and then it sends you back to sleep, ’cause it feels like fentanyl. I don’t know. I like it. I like sitting on the couch on a Sunday and just a nice pinch and roll on my beanbag, you know? Just… [crowd laughs] [man whoops] [scattered whistling] [Tom sighs] “This is free? This is crazy.” [crowd laughing] “I wish it were Seven’s hand, but this feels good, you know?” A lot of ladies get jealous about that, and honestly, you shouldn’t. I’ve seen what you have there, and there’s plenty to pull, so you could also just… [crowd laughs] Tug on that taffy bag and see where it takes you. [Tom sighs] Yeah, and don’t you dare get insecure, okay? You ladies do that to each other. We never care. It could have teeth, and we try to get in there. We don’t care. All I’m saying is, ladies, I want you to leave here tonight knowing that you all have beautiful pussies, okay? Yeah, sure. [cheers rise] Oh yeah, absolutely. So I’m peeing, right? Um… And as I’m peeing, I feel something, you know, in the chamber. And I’m polite, so I do the polite thing. I… hmm… mmm… look around, and there’s nobody in there. So I tell myself, “It’s okay, buddy.” “Why don’t you give it a push?” And I did, and there was no sound. None. But there was movement. So now I have to check. Do you know how you have to check? You have to take your pants all the way down. Like a fucking toddler. I was like… So now I’m just Winnie the Pooh-ing it in a T-shirt. Like… “Hi.” “Hello.” My little dick’s hanging out. “Hello.” Then I look into my boxers, and I’m like, “Yep, I’m throwing those out.” And then I clean up, and then I leave the restroom. All my friends are waiting outside, and I tell them what happened. They’re like, “I don’t wanna know.” And I go, “I’m telling you.” And they go, “Well, stop.” I go, “I’m not. You already know now.” And in that exchange, something clicked. I put it together. I didn’t shart. I had simply shit my pants. Yeah. I mean… [scattered clapping] That’s an important distinction, right? A shart would imply that I had farted, and that there were some DVD extras in there. I took a shit with my pants on. It would be no different than if I were standing here like, “I think I’m gonna take a shit right now.” And then I just kept talking. So, it’s fucked with my confidence, but I’m back, baby. I am fucking back. Yes. [loud cheers and applause] Thank you. Also, let me tell you something. This is my sixth hour special, and I’m very, very grateful that I have this opportunity. Yeah. [crowd cheering and whooping] I tell people a lot, and it’s true, that I really didn’t think this was in the cards for me. I didn’t think about this ever when I started out in entertainment. I really thought the highlight of my career was many, many years ago when I booked the international campaign to be the spokesman for Subway. Now… that’s a real thing. That really happened to me. It took ten auditions. And when I got the call that I had booked this job, I had the same thought that many of you are probably having right now, which is, what about Jared, you know? [crowd laughs] Jared, the now former spokesman, was really prominent in advertising at this time. So when I got the call that I was the new spokesman, I asked them. I was like, “Wait, am I replacing Jared?” And they were like, “Fuck no.” See, if you don’t know this man’s story, he used to weigh 500 pounds, and he would go to his local Subway, and he would order a six-inch turkey sub, and he’d go on long walks. And over the course of several years, he lost nearly 300 pounds. Well, Subway did a one-time commercial that was so successful, they named him the permanent spokesman. But the problem was… [crowd laughs lightly] They could only use Jared to promote their healthy subs. And they needed someone… that looked like they could shit standing up, right? That’s where your boy came in. I was like, “Wait a minute, Jared’s gonna say, ‘Eat the turkey sub and the veggie sub.'” “What am I gonna say?” They’re like, “You’re gonna say, ‘Don’t forget we have a meatball sub too.'” I was like, “Okay, I can do that.” But my next question was more relevant. I was like, “Wait, Jared plays himself. He’s Jared.” “Am I playing Tom, the comedian, in these commercials?” And they were like, “No, Jared will remain Jared.” “You, Tom, are gonna play his derelict brother who’s a mess and eats like a fucking raccoon.” [crowd laughs] I was like, “Okay, I can do that.” I go, “I’m a character.” They go, “Yes, you’re a character.” I go, “Great, what’s my name?” And they go, “Jerome.” I took a beat and I go, “That’s a Black guy’s name.” And I’ll never forget the chief marketing officer of Subway looked me dead in my face, and he goes, “Anybody can be named Jerome.” [crowd laughs] I go, “Yeah, anybody can be named Tanner.” “That’s a fucking white guy’s name, isn’t it?” He goes, “We’ll take your concerns back to the board.” Two weeks later, I am in New York City and I’m doing a wardrobe fitting to start shooting the commercials. This guy walks into my dressing room and he goes, “Hey, everybody agreed with your name issue.” And I go… [crowd laughs] “No shit.” “What’s the new name? Jeff, Jason?” He goes, “Jermaine.” I go, “That is way Blacker.” “Am I wearing gold fronts in these commercials?” He goes, “It’s settled.” I go, “Okay.” And then we shot commercials, you guys. We shot a bunch of commercials. Then we went on hiatus and we were gonna shoot six more commercials to launch this massive campaign. Well, the marketing guy resigned. A new guy came in, and he killed the ads. So I got the call. They go, “It’s over. These are never gonna air.” “You don’t get the contract. This is not happening.” And I got so depressed. I was like, “This was my big shot. It slipped through my fingers.” “I’m never gonna have another opportunity like this again.” I just couldn’t see the light. And then… [light laughter rises] About ten years went by. And one day I turned on the television, and our old buddy Jared was on TV too. Only it wasn’t a Subway commercial. It was the evening news. And they were reporting that Jared was being sentenced to 19 years in prison for child pornography. I dropped to my knees. “Thank you, Jesus.” “Thank you for taking that away. I’m sorry I ever doubted you.” “I will never do it again.” Because if that campaign had aired, it would have been ten years of us doing commercials together, being on billboards together, doing public appearances together. And the day that awful news dropped about him, all of you would have seen me on the street and been like, “Hey, Jermaine!” [crowd laughing loudly] I’d be like, “What? I’m Tom.” And you’d go, “Shut up, you Black piece of shit.” [crowd laughing] [exclaims] And you’d go, “You fucking knew!” “You fucking knew!” I’d go, “I don’t know anything. I don’t know what to say.” “Eat fresh. I’m sorry.” So… I’m glad this worked out. This is way more fun. So thank you for being here, and… [loud cheers and applause] Yeah… I do still have his phone number, if you’re wondering. I did try sending him a link one time… to adult porn. Because I thought he wouldn’t like it, but… [Tom chuckling] Hey, did you guys know… did you know, that in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, at the naval prison that houses some of the most dangerous men on earth and also other people… who have never done anything. Did you know… Look it up. Did you know that the guards there are specially trained? Now, I know this because I went there. I went to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to do shows for fucking us. Yeah, for the troops. They weren’t like, “Here’s the 9\/11 planners.” “Why don’t you give them a giggle?” That’d be insane if they’re like, “Get in there and you make Khalid Sheikh Mohammed laugh.” And I’m like, “What the fuck?” [pops lips] He’s like, “Ha, ha, ha. I like. He’s a funny guy.” So when you go to GITMO, you don’t just buy a ticket, right? You fly to Florida, and a military plane picks you up and they take you to the base, and you’re greeted by high-ranking naval officers, and they’re pretty formal. They go, “Thank you for coming. We’re excited for your show.” “We’ll put you in the housing unit. Let us know if you need anything.” You go, “Thanks very much.” And then they pass you off to some Marines who are a little different. And then first thing these guys said to me, they go, “You want to see some shit?” [crowd laughs] I go, “Yeah, fuck yeah, of course, yes.” So these guys put me in a Jeep, and they took me to a hilltop. They’re like, “You shouldn’t be up here. It’s classified.” I go, “You just fucking drove me here.” They’re like, “All right, good point.” They point to this white building. They go, “That’s level four.” “That’s what you see on the news.” I go, “Wow.” Then they tell me this fascinating insight. They tell me that the guards there are specially trained. So I assume they’re talking about Navy SEALs. They go, “No, they’re trained for their demeanor, how they carry themselves.” “What do you mean?” They said, “The prisoners often protest their imprisonment by throwing their feces and their urine in the guards’ faces.” And the guards are not allowed to retaliate. They’re only allowed to say two things back to the prisoner when that happens. They’re allowed to say, “Are you hungry?” Or, “Are you thirsty?” That’s it. And if the… [chuckles] If the guard… [stifling chuckle] It’s funny when you think about it. If the guarddoesretaliate, the guard can be court-martialed, meaning you can go to prison for retaliating against someone who threw shit and piss in your face. [crowd laughs] This is what it’s like to be the father of a six-year-old boy. Yeah, that’s called an A1 setup. That’s why I’m a big-time comedian. Sure. [cheers and applause] I have two sons. They’re both kind of dicks, but… The six-year-old, I walk into my house a couple weeks ago, he goes, “Hey, man.” He goes, “Pick me up.” I go, “Pick you up?” He goes, “Hold me.” He hasn’t asked me to hold him in like a year. I go, “You want me to hold you?” He goes, “Yeah, pick me up.” All right, so I pick him up. I’m looking at my baby boy. “You just want Dad to hold you?” He goes, “It feels good, man.” I go, “I like it too, buddy.” And then a moment later, I feel a hot, piercing, spreading sensation on my midsection. I go, “Are you peeing on me?” And he goes, “Yeah.” I wanted to hit him so bad. Like really hit him too, you know? Like… Like… knock his fucking teeth out of his mouth. But I didn’t. I dropped him. I go, “You hungry?” “You thirsty?” “Is that why you did that?” [loud cheers and laughter] This kid is insane. I mean, he hates his real name. And this is something that came about a few years ago. And when it first happened, I got kind of nervous. I did what you do in those situations. I asked other parents, and they were like, “It’s just a phase.” I go, “What?” “It’s a little phase.” “He’s going through a phase.” “A lot of kids don’t like their names. It’ll end in a little bit.” I was like, “It’s a phase? Do you know how long it’s been? About three years.” That isn’t so much a phase in my opinion as a new path. That’s where I think we are. His birth name is Julian. That’s what we’ve always called him. And that’s what he used to respond to because it’s his fucking name, right? He would also respond to variations of it. Julian, Juju, Jujito,Julian.And he’d be like, “Mm-hmm.” And then one day, about three years ago, I was like, “Hey, Julian.” He was like, “Don’t ever call me that. I hate that name.” “When you say that name, I want to die.” And I’m like, “Oh my God, okay.” So now this kid will only talk to us if we call him by his self-imposed name, which, buckle up… …is “Teacher.” [crowd laughing] Is there a creepier name… to use when addressing a small child? Like, “Hello, my teacher.” Is thisThe Shining?Because it feels like it. It feels like Jordan Peele’s next movie. Like a fucking kid from the woods that walks into town to follow Teacher and live long. And you’re like, “Okay.” You get it, right? I walk into my own house, and I go, “Is Teacher here?” And he goes, “Yes.” And I go, “Hello, sir.” And people have the balls to ask me. They’re like, “Are you worried?” Of course I’m fucking worried. [crowd laughs] The only other person I know that went by “Teacher” is Charles Manson. So yeah, I’m worried. He was a substitute teacher. Now… His older brother, he likes math. He likes video games. He’s an interesting kid. He also has the voice of somebody who gargles with butane. I don’t know what is happening. He’s nine years old. He’s like, “What’s up, bro?” I go, “Hey.” “How’s working in the mines? Is that fun?” He’s also bananas. If I say, “Let’s go out,” he’s like, “All right.” He’ll come in the living room wearing rain boots, tighty whities, and goggles. And I’m like, “Are you on shrooms right now?” “The only place you can wear that is a gay parade, and…” “No, it’s cool if you are, but there isn’t one today.” “So put some fucking clothes on, okay?” We took these two future subjects ofAmerica’s Most Wanted…[crowd laughs] Believe me, the Menendez brothers don’t have shit on the Segura brothers, okay? We took these little sociopaths to visit my sister last Thanksgiving in Florida. And on Thanksgiving Day, we did what a lot of families down there do. We just went on a family walk, like a nice casual stroll. And on this family walk, we ended up at a little pond. And at the pond, there were other families feeding bread to ducks. It looked like a painting. And I remember, as we approached, thinking to myself, “I wonder how my boys will ruin this.” [crowd laughs] So we walk up, and this guy sees me. He goes, “Hey, man, you want some bread?” I go, “Yeah, thanks, dude.” And then I turn to fucking Teacher. [crowd laughing] [cheers and applause rising] I go, “Hey, Teach.” “Bread?” And he goes, “Give me that.” He’s just throwing it as hard as he can. I’m like, “All right.” Then I turned to his brother. “Here you go.” He goes, “I don’t want that.” I go, “What?” He goes, “I don’t need that.” Happy Thanksgiving. And then he just walks up to the edge of the water, and he grabs a duck by the neck. [crowd laughs] And he holds it up like he’s Genghis Khan, okay? He’s like… You know, the duck is like… [gruff quack] [crowd laughs] [shrill quacking] I look at Teacher, and Teacher’s like… [crowd laughs] I go, “What are you doing?” He goes, “We can cook it.” I go, “No, no.” “We’re all set today, pal.” He goes, “Can I keep it?” I go, “Of course not.” He goes, “You’re never fun.” I go, “Let it go.” And he goes, “Oh.” And then I turn and I see all the other parents who are like… [crowd laughing] I go, “He’s a foster kid. They’re bad, you know?” We’re trying to make him good for you guys. Yeah, well… You know… [cheers and whistling] “We got him in Ukraine. He’s been a handful.” Um… [cackles] He’s blonde. They bought it. [crowd laughs] This tour has been a lot of fun. We’ve gone to a lot of fun places. You learn things sometimes when you travel. You pick up on things. A few weeks ago, we were in Augusta, Georgia, the Coke Zero of their cities. [crowd laughs] Augusta is quite famous, if you don’t know. It’s the home of Augusta National, which is a country club and golf course where they play arguably the most famous tournament in all of golf, appropriately titled, “The Masters.” It’s a curious name choice for the deep South. Now… [crowd laughing] Perhaps a different pronunciation when they named it?Mm-massa. [crowd laughs] I didn’t name it. It was built… The club was built in 1933 by what I would call top-shelf whites. The whitest whites. Whites so white, they sang white songs during their backswings. Like…I’m white… No rhythm or flow, more of a statement, you know? Now, the club is also notorious for having a very exclusionary past. They are not a big fan of “others.” So… we spent all day there, and I decided to look it up. I looked up, “When did they let in their first Black member?” And I’ll give you guys a hint. It’s later than you think. [crowd laughs] Are you ready? 1990. [crowd groans] Yeah, they waited. They were like… [in Southern accent] “Maybe things’ll go back to the way they were. I don’t know.” “You don’t want to act too fast.” “You don’t put on a raincoat just ’cause it’s drizzlin’.” “You know what I’m saying, brother?” [crowd laughs] [Tom chuckles] [no accent] Then I looked up, “When did they let in their first female member?” [blows raspberry] 2012. [crowd laughs] That’s how much women ruin a good time for men. [cheers and applause] [Tom scoffs] I mean, you get it, right? They went to the most racist guys in our country. Guys who their whole lives was just about hating Black people with everything inside of them. And whenthose guyswere presented with the question, “Whom would you rather hang out with?” [scattered laughter] [in Southern accent] “Black guys… or women?” They were like, “Mmm… Give us all the Blacks you got.” [crowd laughs] “We will learn their fancy handshakes. I don’t give a fuck.” “I don’t want some broad yapping in my ear, ruining my Sunday round.” “Uh-uh. Come on, Jermaine, let me show you how we do this.” [crowd laughing and whooping] “Get you a tee.” [cheers and applause] “What’s with all the dancing? You gonna do that after every hole?” “I got me a birdie.” All right, so… [no accent] Are you… [laughs] Are you fans of documentaries? Do you like watching them? Because I… [scattered cheers] I love them. I love being filled with the confidence of surface-level knowledge without the burden of reading, you know? And so I’ve lost track. I’ve seen so many now. Sometimes they’re quite informative. Other times they’re just amusing. I mean, the funniest thing I’ve seen in a year is a Netflix documentary series calledUntold,which focuses on sports stories, yeah. And there’s one in particular on there. It’s about a guy named Johnny Manziel. If you’re in this theater and you do not know who Johnny Manziel is, I will now use my time to tell you. [crowd laughs] Johnny Manziel is the first and only redshirt freshman to win the Heisman Trophy. That’s the highest honor in college football. It goes to the nation’s best player. Redshirt freshman simply means he was 18 months removed from high school when he didn’t just play this sport, he dominated it. And when you watch this documentary, you will learn that he did this while mostly high and drunk. Like, pretty fucked up. The best is they interview all his former shit-kicking Texas-based coaches, who are like, “Yeah, man, he would come to practice. He’d be all shit-faced.” And we would say, “Johnny, you better not fuck this up.” “And then he didn’t. He was awesome.” And you’re like, wait, what? [Tom scoffing] He was playing nationally televised games every Saturday with millions of viewers, either drunk, high, or hungover, just on the sidelines. [retching] And his coaches are like, “Johnny!” And he was like, “Watch this shit, six touchdowns.” You’re like, “Holy shit!” “Give him more drugs. This is working.” He wins the Heisman. Sophomore year, he comes back, he’s trying new things, he’s sprinkling dust on his shit, you know? He’s evolving. He plays amazing. Again, he almost wins it back-to-back. Then he goes into the NFL to play professionally. And they’re like, “You need to clean up your act.” And he was like, “I don’t wanna play football anymore.” And… that’s the whole story. Now… To me, his story is more than that, because for me, in my personal life, I use his story as one that… where I can see I’ve evolved some. See, I used to judge him very harshly. A lot of people do. All they see is a blown opportunity. But the older I’ve gotten, I see it through a different lens. I realize that’s a lot of pressure for a young man to have. A lot of people in their thirties, forties, and fifties can’t handle that, let alone a freshman in college. You know, the celebrity, the fame, the money… And so now I do the thing that you do if you can. You put yourself in someone else’s shoes. And I can do that. I was once a freshman in college. I wasn’t dominating college football. I was going to class, and I was working part-time at a shopping cart manufacturer. A place that makes shopping carts. Here’s how cool that job was. I went in there once on a Monday, and I went up to my boss. I go, “I think I’m gonna quit on Friday.” And he goes, “Yeah, a lot of people do.” Okay. And then on Friday, he goes, “Yeah, you’re done.” I go, “Okay, great.” Then he tells me, “Hey, kid, a lot of people here like you.” “Let’s go to the bar down the street and we’ll toast you to whatever you do next.” I go, “Okay, I’m underage, but let’s do it.” So we went, you know. People from the office came. They were so nice. They gave me good luck cards, little gifts and such. And then one of them gave me a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, which was definitely meant to be a parting gift. You know, like, “Take this with you.” And I was like, “I’ll just drink it here at the bar.” Bartender’s like, “You can’t do that.” I go, “I can’t hear you.” I’m just gonna do it. How can I make fun of Johnny for not being able to handle millions? I can’t handle a free fucking bottle of booze. And let me tell you something, if you don’t drink whiskey, if you start… If you tip back the bottle three or four times, your brain actually goes, “Hey, there’s too many lights on in here.” Beep, bop, boop. [crowd laughs] And you go, “I wanna do bad shit.” I started taking people’s change that was on the bar. I was like, “That’s my shit, fuck you.” [crowd laughs] My friends were like, “Hey, calm down.” I go, “You fucking calm down.” Then I ended up going home with a lady who had amostunfortunate face. Yeah. [crowd laughs] You think I’m being mean, but I know I’m being honest. That’s why we’re here. [scattered laughter] I blacked out, thankfully. Um… Some of you never blacked out. Congratulations on your healthy lifestyle choices. But… the rest of us know it is horrifying. I mean, I remember I woke up that next morning. I was looking out a window into a yard I didn’t recognize. And I was like, “Where am I?” “And what is this?” And then I turned over, and this fucking gargoyle appeared. [crowd laughs] And I audibly gasped in her face. You understand? Like, I’m here. And I went… “Ohh!” Ahh! And she was used to it. She was like, “I know. I know.” [crowd laughing] “You’re not the first fella to dothat.” She looked like Bill Belichick, the former… Patriots coach. Picture him with shoulder-length, brown hair. Same face, same body. I was like, “Put the fucking hoodie on. I don’t want to see this.” And then I left there, you guys, feeling tremendous shame. I told you I was a freshman in college. I was taking Psychology 101. We had talked about shame. You know what they teach you about shame? They teach you that shame thrives in secret. If you feel shame about anything, you should confide it in at least one other person to help release the feeling. But if you keep it inside, it festers and grows, and it can consume you. And I remember thinking back then, “How fascinating.” “I feel shame and I know what to do.” “Tell someone.” And then I thought, “Fuck that.” “I will die with this secret… and bury it under pizza.” And as I was doing that, I remember getting a call from a guy who was at that bar the night before. He goes, “Hey, man, where did you go after the bar?” And I said, “I went home.” And he goes, “Did ya?” I go, “Yeah.” He goes, “I don’t think you did.” I go, “No, I did.” And he goes, “Mm, you didn’t.” [crowd laughs] I go, “What are you talking about?” He goes, “We can stop doing this.” “I’ll tell you what you did.” I go, “Okay, what did I do?” And he goes, “Dude, you fucked my aunt.” [crowd groaning and laughing] [crowd reactions rising] [cheers and applause] I say, “Your aunt is Bill Belichick?” [crowd laughs] He goes, “Yeah.” I didn’t know what to say, so I just said, “I’m sorry.” He goes, “No, I’m sorry.” He goes, “I don’t wanna fuck any of my aunts, but Bill is definitely last on that list.” [chuckles] I switched to weed that day. Sometimes you watch documentaries, and it’s a whole different experience. Like, it’s just enlightening. You get information that you can’t let go of. It just sits in your mind. You tell people about it. It’s in your dreams. I mean, I watched one not long ago that if I had not watched it, I would have no idea how much cocaine Hitler did. No idea. Like, everybody knows the Third Reich was on meth. You know that, right? The entire German army. They were on meth during World War II. Picture that. A hundred thousand German soldiers marching through the Ardennes Forest. Supposed to take six days, and they did it in 28 minutes. That’s meth. Imagine you’re sitting in a cabin in Belgium just drinking fucking milk, I guess… [speaking French] And you hear… [shouts in German] And you’re like, “Holy shit.” [speaking French] I mean, that’s meth… You been around somebody on meth? I have. It’s unsettling. They never stop talking. They want to fuck everything. And those are Americans. Can you imagine what these kinky-ass Germans were like? Just… Mmm… “Oh… I want you to suck me dry–” “Hey!” “Gunther, back off.” Now, Hitler did meth too. It’s very well documented. A lot of people don’t know he was given cocaine in the mornings by his personal doctor. Like, you think Michael Jackson’s doctor was out of line? That was propofol to go to sleep. That’s JV shit, okay? Like, “I want to go to sleep.” “Oh, fuck.” Hitler would wake up, and then his doctor was like, “Good morning, my Führer.” And fucking… [snorts] And then he was like, “Ah, Jews!” [crowd laughing] Dude, to start your day with an eight ball and a heart full of hatred is wild. [crowd laughs] Here’s what I really want to know. Why am I learning about this at 46? I feel like every little kid should know this. Kindergartners should come up to all of us and be like, “You know how much cocaine Hitler did?” You don’t think that’s the best deterrent story for a kid? I do. When I was a kid, they’d go, “Don’t do coke.” And you’d go, “Why?” And they’re like, “That’s what rock stars do.” And you’re like, “Oh, okay.” [crowd laughs] “You mean like Slash and Eric Clapton?” And they’re like, “Yes, they’re up till 6:00 a.m., and they’re shaving their bodies…” [chuckles] “…and they’re fucking girls.” “Is that what you want to do?” And you’d be like, “Boo!” “Anybody else do coke?” “Yeah, Martin Scorsese.” You’re like, “Yeah, that fucking worked out.” “How about a bad guy?” “Uh-uh, we don’t have any.” Well, there is this one. I don’t know if you’ve heard of him. His name is Adolf fucking Hitler. He was doing mountains of coke. By the way, he was having the same dumb conversations your friends have. He was just having them about war. He was like, “We should go to Stalingrad in December.” “Haha, and we’ll fuck them up, hahaha!” [crowd laughing] “Hey! Look at my mustache. I cut off the sides.” [crowd laughs] [cheers rising] [cheers and applause] “You guys want to see my art? It’s pretty good.” “It’s mostly me choking ducks. Look at this shit.” [crowd laughs] “You think Mussolini likes me?” All right, well… No, it should be said. He was a real knucklehead. [stifling chuckle] Cool accent, though.Ja![crowd laughs] See, I’ve always had a fascination with languages. So, if you don’t know, half my family is from South America. They’re from Peru. I’ve been going there… Yeah. I’ve been going there my whole life. My relatives have been visiting me my whole life. Did you know that every time one of my 288 cousins comes to visit me, they always say the same sentence incorrectly, and they have for over 30 years. One of them… during their visit, one of them will come up to me and go… [in Peruvian accent] “Tommy. Um… I have to, uh… make a shit.” [crowd laughs] And I go, “I understand.” If you speak any Spanish, you realize what’s happening. It’s a literal translation. Because in Spanish, you would say,“hacer,”which is “to make,” which, to be fair to all Spanish speakers, it is exactly what you are doing. You are, in fact, making shit. I always correct them to be polite. “We don’t say that here.” “Here, we say I have to take… a shit.” And they always go, “Why?” “I will not take it anywhere.” [crowd laughs] I go, “Yeah, your logic is sound, but… if you keep saying, ‘I’m making shit in the toilet,’ someone’s gonna call the cops, so just follow my lead.” See, if you’re at this show, you speak the world’s language. The world’s language is English. Most of you, like me, did absolutely nothing to learn it. You were just born. And the rest of the world tries so hard just to communicate withus, just to participate with us, and then we mock them to their face for trying. [crowd laughs] Isn’t that great? The whole world goes, “Um, how do you say…” and we go… [babbling] [crowd laughs] “Listen to this fucking idiot.” Like you did something. “I do not know…” [babbling] “Shut up, stupid.” It’s like his eighth language. Some redneck’s like, “You don’t fucking talk good.” “Fucking don’t talk so much.” And you’re like, “Yeah.” “Yeah, what he said, for sure.” You can do that if you want. You can mock people who have not mastered what you have. It’s rude. With language, you’re gonna hurt people’s feelings. You know what everybody enjoys everywhere? I swear, everywhere. If you can do an accent well, people treat you like you’re a goddamn magician. They love it. Go try it at work. On Monday, just go to work and be like… [in British accent] “Hello, mate.” [crowd laughs] “Would you like a biscuit with your tea?” Someone in your office is gonna go, “No-uh.” I mean, you can do all the… Walk around… [laughing in French accent] “Would you like a croissant with your coffee?” “Would you like tomangemy anus?” Whatever, say whatever you want. And you can do all the accents. Obviously not Asian, which is a bummer, because that’s the most fun one to do. [crowd laughs] You’ll continue to do that when you’re alone, and with friends, and with family, and… in the shower, and in the car, and with lovers, because there’s nothing better, but you can’t do it, you know? You can do a little. You can do a note. It’s sort of like you can walk up to a piano and you can hit a key, right? You can be in public and go, like… [in random Asian accent] “Oh…” Like that. You know. People still get jumpy. They’ll be like, “What the fuck are you doing?” [crowd laughs] You can’t go the whole way. You can’t be like, “I would like to…” [babbling in random Asian accent] You can’t. I did it to show you, but you can’t do that. [crowd laughs] If you want to have fun with an Asian person speaking, and you’re not Asian, what you should do is simply learn how to say something in an Asian language. Then you’re repeating words. You’re allowed to do that. I’ve been working on this Mandarin. [scattered laughter] [Tom sighs] It’s rough, but… [chuckles] Here we go. [clears throat] [crowd laughs] [speaking Mandarin] [continues phrase] [crowd laughs] [cheers and applause] Thank you. That means, “Kill my daughter. She is worthless.” Because they prefer boys, you know what I mean? Like… Another girl, throw her against the tree. Now… I did that joke in Hong Kong, and it did not land. [crowd laughs] Yeah, they hate trees, but… [crowd laughs] I don’t know how I’d react. I have boys, but… I don’t even know whose credit that is. Is that mine? Is that my wife’s? I mean, she can take a load… [crowd groans and laughs] Between the legs. What I’m saying is… I get blow jobs, but I get married blow jobs. Them ain’t like single-life blow jobs. Married blow jobs kind of remind me… You ever watch your dog… on a hot day get some water from its bowl? And then it looks at you between licks. You know? It’s like… [crowd laughing] You’re like, “Yeah, that feels good, that’s nice. Very nice.” “Are you done?” “Yeah, I didn’t want to come. Thanks, that was fun.” [crowd laughs] I still remember the good old days, yeah. Yeah, I have old VHS tapes back here, and they’re a little grainy, but if I close my eyes, I can still see those sweet, sweet angels from my twenties who made sounds like they were fighting for their life. You know, just… [retching] [hoarse gagging] You know those blow jobs where you almost stop to see if she’s okay? [crowd laughs] You don’t, ’cause you don’t care. [crowd laughs] You’re like, “I like that you’re suffering. This is cool.” [mimics spitting] [crowd laughs] What, you don’t have memories? Okay. [Tom sighs] I like a finger up the butt. [crowd laughs] Let’s be clear. I don’t want to be excavated, okay? [crowd laughs] I just like a little, you know… A little Steve Aoki. “What’s this button do?” [making DJ mixtape noises] Prime the pump, don’t frack the crack. You’re with me, right? Yeah. You like that, sir? Yes. The ‘stache gives it away. I knew you were in. You? Fuck yeah, all the culture’s up front. I polled my entire inner circle of close friends, and they were all like, “Fuck, no.” “I don’t like that. That shit is gay.” And I was like, “Well, have you ever considered trying it with a woman?” That’s not gay. Maybe stop having your brother do it, weirdo, and… “Hurry up before dad gets home.” [crowd laughing] This is what you learn over the course of a lifetime about sex. You learn that men and women, we both lie about sex. We just lie in opposite directions. Men exaggerate their exploits and their interests simply because they live to impress women. It’s the truth. It’s stupid, and it’s simple, and it’s true. Every woman in here, at some point, you’ll meet a guy like, “I like it all.” “Step on my nuts,” and, um… You know, “Cut my nipples open.” [crowd laughs] “Set me on fire.” And then you’re like, “Okay…” [crowd laughs] “He seems fun.” Then you get him in bed. What happens? He’s like, “Is that a match? I don’t feel safe. I wanna call…” “Oh, right, sure. Okay.” He’s a fucking liar. He’s a liar. Now, women do the opposite lie. Women diminish their accountability when it comes to sex, but I’ll defend you. I think you do it for a very good reason. The reason a lot of women diminish their accountability when it comes to sex is they have a very real and valid fear that some men will shame them for enjoying some of the same things that they enjoy. Isn’t that right, ladies? [women cheering and clapping] All right, so there’s like 30 whores here. That’s crazy. [Tom chuckles] I’m kidding. [snickering] I’m kidding. Thank you for cheering. [crowd laughs] Then, you know, I think about, like, things that happen in my own life, and I realize that these theories are true. I remember I had a roommate one time, and we both knew this beautiful girl named Nicole. And one day, my roommate goes, “Oh, I hooked up with Nicole.” And I go, “Oh, really?” And then he said something super weird and gross, and I apologize in advance, but he was like, he goes, “Yeah, man, her puss…” [crowd laughing] He made sounds, which also made it way worse, you know? He was like, “Mm.” I was like, “Oh!” He was like, “It was so snuggly warm, you know?” “I wanted to take a nap in there,” and I was like, “What?” He’s like, “Yeah, mmm! Felt so good.” He goes, “It felt like a blanket that was lined with butter.” And I go, “What the fuck?” [crowd laughs] And then I dated her for two months after that. [crowd laughs] You know why? ‘Cause I like butter too, sir. [crowd laughs] One day I’m with her. I guess I’m feeling insecure. I bring it up. I go, “It’s kind of weird you’ve hooked up with my roommate.” And she goes, “What?” I go, “Yeah.” She goes, “I’ve never touched your roommate.” I go, “Really?” She goes, “Hell no.” I go, “Okay.” So I go back to my place. I go, “Hey, man, she said you guys never hooked up.” And he goes, “Oh yeah, that’s true.” [crowd laughs] I go, “I should have known from the buttered-blanket pussy line.” I go, “Why would you tell me that?” He goes, “Who cares” and turned on the TV. That was our whole conversation about it. Years later, I was dating another woman and we were talking about sex, like the topic of sex. And I brought up threesomes. I go, “Have you ever had a threesome?” You know what she said? She goes… I go, “I didn’t ask, ‘Did you remember to take your Adderall today?'” “Have you had sex with two other people at the same time?” She goes, “Not really.” I go, “‘Not really’? Was one of them an amputee?” ‘Cause that still counts. [crowd laughs] And she goes, “Well, here’s the thing.” I go, “This is a ‘here’s the thing’?” She goes, “Yes,technicallyI was in one, but I was sunburned.” And I go, “What the fuck?” She goes, “I was in there, but didn’t really participate ’cause my sunburn was killing me.” I go, “This is insane women’s-only logic you got going on right now.” She goes, “How about you?” I go, “I blew four guys, but I had poison ivy, so it doesn’t count either.” [crowd laughs] Just… [cheers and applause] [people in crowd whistling] She was an absolute whore. And… she’s dead. [scattered groans and laughter] Probably. You know, I’ve been thinking about killingmy wife. [crowd laughs] I’ve been talking about it too. Mostly with my wife. [chuckles] It’s her fault. She started it. We were in the house one day, and she just lobs this at me. She goes, “How easily do you think you could kill me with your bare hands?” I go, “Uh, very.” [crowd laughs] She goes, “Really?” I go, “It wouldn’t even be a little bit hard.” [crowd laughs] She goes, “No!” And I go, “Yeah.” “I’m not saying I’m a badass. I’m saying I can killyouwith little to no effort.” Now this shit comes up all the time. Like, whenever we’re together. We were in New York. We were waiting for the subway, just standing there. And at one point I was like, “Oh, I could fucking… [crowd laughs] …shove you off of that platform right now.” And she looks, she goes, “I would die.” I go, “No shit.” [crowd laughs] Then she goes, “You shouldn’t.” I go, “What?” She goes, “There’s cameras here, and there’s people everywhere.” “You’re gonna get caught.” [crowd laughs] I was like, “Yeah, good looking out. Okay.” We went to Hawaii. We were on a hike just on this cliff’s edge. And at one point I put my hands on her shoulders. I go, “You know, if I wanted to, I could… [grunts] …throw you off.” And she looks. She goes, “I would die.” I go, “You’re getting good at this. Yeah.” [crowd laughs] I go, “Of course I’m not going to. There’s rocks.” “Your body would be exposed. There’d be detectives everywhere.” “It would fuck up my day. I’m not doing it.” I go, “But if you look down there, I don’t see any rocks.” “Over there, the tide would take you out.” “And then I would have an awesome week in Hawaii.” [crowd laughs] And then we kissed. I guess that’s love, right? Yeah, but she’s alive. [light laughter] Isn’t she? Yeah. You know, we’ve been together, I think 63 years now, and… You get to that point in your relationship where you’re like, “I’m riding it out with this one, right?” But you can’t help sometimes to think about who it could have been. Don’t you ever play that game? You think back and you think about one, you’re like, “Oof, Jesus, I really dodged a bullet there.” Then you think about another one, “That could have been cool.” You think about all of them. I had one hit me the other day. I was remembering that I studied abroad. I did a semester in Madrid. I remembered one time an American classmate of mine came up to me, and he goes, “Hey, I’m going to Tunisia this weekend, North Africa.” “Do you wanna come?” And I go, “Not really, no.” Then he called me out. He goes, “When will you have the chance to see a place like that after such a short flight?” “You really should go.” And I thanked him. I said, “You’re right, I’m coming.” We went. We went to Tunisia. We checked into a hotel. We see this beautiful woman in the lobby. We approach her together, but we’re gentlemen. I go, “Hey, we’re American students. We’re studying in Spain.” “We’re here for the weekend.” She goes, “I’m French.” “I’m traveling alone. I’m looking for heroin today.” And my friend goes, “She’s yours.” And then he just… walked away. And I was like, “Let’s see where it goes,” you know? We rode camels, you know, we tried to score some H. [chuckles] Then we’re in her room later. And we’re making out, it’s starting to heat up. And I wanna make this very clear to everybody. I stopher,and I go, “I gotta tell you something.” “I don’t have a condom and, no offense…” [chuckling] “…I think I need one.” She goes, “You don’t need a condom.” I go, “Ah…” “Okay.” So… [crowd laughs] You said so, and I’m dumb. So we did what we did. And then I go back to my room, and my friend’s there. He goes, “Where have you been?” I go, “The French girl. I just hooked up with her.” And his first question, he goes, “You have a condom?” And I go, “No.” And his face dropped. And he goes, “You’re gonna die.” [crowd laughs] And I go, “I am gonna die.” I didn’t sleep one second. In the morning, I go downstairs for breakfast, for fucking Tunisian breakfast. It was like dates and hummus. I was like, “You’re gonna eat this first thing and wash it down with coffee?” “You’re gonna shit some memories out right now.” [crowd laughs] So I ate, I shat, and I saw her. She knew something was up. She’s like, “What is wrong?” I go, “Last night, we did what we did, and we didn’t use protection.” And she goes, “That’s okay.” And I go… [chuckling dryly] “No, it’s not.” And she goes, “It’s okay because I take medicine.” [softly] I go, “Why do you take medicine?” “Is your T cell count like 12 or something?” [crowd laughs] She goes, “I take medicine to not make babies.” I go, “The pill?” [laughing] “You think I’m worried…” [crowd laughs] “…about getting you pregnant?” “How would you even find me?” [crowd laughs] “You just gonna write a letter?” “Dear America…” [crowd laughs] “A man calling himself Big Daddy Kane fucked me…” “…in North Africa.” And she goes, “Calm down.” I go, “I can’t!” This woman reached into her purse and pulled out pills. I didn’t even ask what they were. I was just like… “What was that, vitamin C?” She goes, “Xanax. You just ate three Xanax.” “And now you’re gonna relax, you big baby.” And like a minute later, I go, “Mm-hmm.” “I am relaxed.” And then we went up to her room, and we had unprotected sex again. And that’s how I got AIDS. I don’t know. Um… [crowd laughs] I’ve never been tested. And guess what, guys? I’m not gonna be. Because it’s better not to know. At this point, I’ve got it. My wife’s got it. The boys have got it. Seven’s got it. [cheers and applause] Bill Belichick definitely has it. But you know what? I feel good skinny. So thank you, AIDS, and thank you, Milwaukee. You guys were the best. Thanks very much. Have a great night. Thank you.
